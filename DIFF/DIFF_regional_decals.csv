decals/us_mama_cas_text;"""Mama CAS"" Inscription"
decals/us_mama_cas_text/desc;The personal inscription of Thomas Harritt, 175th Wing, USAF. During the late 1980s, regulations regarding nose art began to ease in the US Air Force, giving pilots more freedom to create personal designs for their aircraft. The drive generally aimed to preserve the heritage of the Second World War, and instill a sense of inherited duty into new pilots by allowing them to emulate previous practices. The 175th Wing were the trendsetters with this revival, with Thomas and fellow pilot Jim Czachorowski responsible for most of the nose art, initially using tempera paint for the first designs as it was easier to remove in case of complaints. The pinups and markings they created drastically increased the spirits and pride of the pilots, helping to revitalize the practice into the 1990s. This stencil applied by Thomas was positioned on the nose of his A-10 Warthog at a slight angle, just in front of the cockpit.
decals/ussr_boatswain_specialist;Boatswain Specialist Emblem
decals/ussr_boatswain_specialist/desc;Boatswain specialist patch, Soviet Navy. During the mid-1950s, several patches were created for specialist roles within the naval forces. These ranged from very specific duties, such as electrical specialists for torpedo maintenance, to more general roles such as this one. Functionally, boatswain specialists were primarily responsible for seakeeping, ensuring the vessel was effectively maintained and safe to operate at sea. While still a very general design, this duty is reflected in the emblem, with the chain around the anchor imbuing a sense of security. The rims of the patches were upgraded to gold if the wearer had remained in service beyond their term, but by default were red and black. These emblems were generally limited to shoulder patches and navy ephemera and were gradually phased out during the 1980s.
decals/cn_meritorious_warrior_white;Meritorious Warrior I Inscription
decals/cn_meritorious_warrior_white/desc;"""Meritorious Warrior"" (功臣號) inscription, PLA. In 1945 PLA forces captured a pair of Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai tanks, naming them 101 and 102. During repairs, tank 101 was sabotaged, and only tank 102 was made operational and evacuated. 102 would become the first ever tank of the PLA, and while details of its combat history are somewhat nebulous, it was regarded as a very effective asset for the army. By 1948 the army had acquired several additional tanks, but 102 remained the favorite, and received the affectionate nickname ""Old Man Tank"" (老头坦克) within the ranks. During one of its final battles where the tank played a vital role, this nickname was inverted into the current inscription, ""Meritorious Warrior"", or more contextually, ""Heroic Tank"". This inscription was placed on the hull sides of the tank after the fighting, and could be seen in various parades and press photos."
decals/it_snail_bomber_106;"""Snail Bomber"" Marking, 106 Gruppo BT"
decals/it_snail_bomber_106/desc;"The marking of 106 Gruppo BT (106th Land-Based Bomber Group), Regia Aeronautica. A relatively obscure marking, it can be placed in southern Italy in 1940 on at least one aircraft. It depicts a snail dropping bombs from the clouds, complete with gunners inside the shell. Interestingly, the marking of the 107th Group is very similar — using a tortoise instead of a snail with the same general design. While the history of the marking is scarce, it may derive from both creatures being slow but well defended, making them fitting designs for bomber squadrons. Many Italian bombers of the era also utilized ""tortoise shell"" camouflage for their aircraft, which occurs naturally on both animals as well. The marking was positioned on the tail of a Z.1007, above the serial number, with the head of the snail pointing toward the rear of the plane."
decals/se_sleipnir_text;"""Sleipnir"" Inscription"
decals/se_sleipnir_text/desc;"""Sleipnir"" inscription, Jämtlands Fältjägarregemente I5 (Jämtland Field Fighter Regiment), Swedish Army. While written accounts of Sleipnir begin around the 13th century, the figure likely originated hundreds of years earlier in the Viking Age. In Norse mythology Sleipnir is the eight-legged horse of Odin, fastest and most powerful of all the horses — and something of a psychopomp figure, guiding souls through different realms. The regiment is known for their mythology-inspired inscriptions, often referencing gods and legends. Interestingly this marking was painted in negative space, a typography style rarely used in this medium, which, ironically, makes it stand out more. It was placed on the left side of the gun housing on one of the regiment’s CV9040A vehicles."
