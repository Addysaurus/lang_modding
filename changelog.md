# Changelog

In this document you will find the changelog for this mod documenting every change made in every version. This changelog was started with version 1.08.58, but will be retroactively updated for older versions of the mod, starting with version 1.06.04 since 1.06.03 is the first version to be committed to GitHub and thus differences can only be documented from 1.06.04.

In the case of a weapon name changing, that change will not be listed in the modifications section. Instead, it will be listed in the weapons section with a note saying the modification name was changed accordingly, unless there is a reason for the modification's name to be different, in which case a seperate entry will exist in the modifications section.

In the case of a weapon being renamed in the same patch that its weight or caliber and weapon type tags are added, the list of tag changes will use the renamed version of the weapon.

Some terminology for this changelog:
- Short name: The name that appears for the vehicle card in the tech tree and lineup.
- Statcad name/long name: The name that appears on the statcard or as the longer version of a weapon's name.
- Mid distance name: The name that appears at medium distances from a vehicle.
- Long distance name: The name that appears at long distances from a vehicle.
- Caliber/mass tag: Yellow colored text in front of a weapon's long name denoting its caliber or mass, depending on what is appropriate for the weapon type.
- Type tag: Orange colored text at the end of a weapon's long name denoting the type of weapon in abbreviations.

All dates are listed in DD-MM-YYYY format.

## 1.13.03 — UNRELEASED

I would like to greatly thank [atta26hu](https://forum.warthunder.com/u/atta26hu) for helping with the Hungarian ground tree rework. Without their help, this rework would not have been possible and the sourcing work they did for it was instrumental to it coming out as good as it did.

### General:

- #### Changes:

    - The Japanese package has been moved over to using Japanese numerals where they were used in real life to match the Chinese package currently in development. Writing every change would be a 400 line changelog so this is the 1 line covering it. Any additional listed changes for Japanese stuff are changes made for reasons that are not Japanese numerals. Modern Kanji have also been replaced with the old imperial Kanji where it is historically accurate, especially replacing the character 駆 with 驅 (this is being listed here because it would be another giant changelog) (this is mostly a naval thing that happpened when I was burying through documents for the **Dai 18 Gō** and everything spiraled out of control extremely fast and now I'm stuck here, please help me ahhhhhhhhh)

        - It's all confusing. Different file entries labeled almost exactly the same and used for different things. I don't really understand it and there's no good way to explain it in the changelog. Just roll with it, the point is that the TOW boxes' ammunition loadouts make sense now.

            - In real life, these are the same launcher: the SLAMRAAM.

## 1.12.04 - 10-05-2025

### General:

The basic infrastructure has been added for modifying the names and descriptions of decals and skins, and in the future, potentially more content in the regional files. Other mods, notably [leroyonly's](https://github.com/leroyonly/warthunder-lang), have previously figured out how to edit the regional files using the adding files method that this mod, as well as [InFerNos1's mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/warthunder/mods/2162), [leroyonly's mod](https://github.com/leroyonly/warthunder-lang), and the [Localization Overhaul Project](https://live.warthunder.com/post/1135601/en/) use. That method involves breaking the base reference to the regional file and then re-referencing it to a custom file. Leroyonly taught me how to do this. However, this comes with an issue: it means things need to be added to the mod's regional file every time a new decal is added or event starts or anything. This would mean a mod update every few days, something this mod cannot sustain. However, this mod is now the first to figure out how to modify the regional files with the adding files method while avoiding that issue. It is done by still breaking the original regional reference by setting it a fake file, but then you re-reference the original regional file in `locTable` with `file:t` instead of `regional:t`. Then you add your own file on top of it as normal.

You do not need to actually know how this works. I am including this in here in case you are curious. The point is that it is now possible to edit decal and skin names while avoiding the previously present issues.

### Weaponry:

- The new Full Ammunition Names package has been released. It currently only applies to 4 rounds, but will apply to more types of ammunition going forward, including the upcoming British weaponry rework that is currently in its sourcing phase. Certain ammunition names, especially those that list the cartridge seperately, either have shortened forms that do not fully describe the ammunition, or in the case of British ammuniton, do not have shortened forms at all. The base mod will have names shortened to be as accurate as they can while still short, but in the case of British ammuniton, the shortened forms will have to be ahistorical. The new Full Ammunition Names package will contain the complete names for ammunition. This is because, unlike with missiles and bombs, the game does not have long and short names for ammunition for guns.

        - **strv m/42 TM (DT)**

- #### Changes:

    - **FV4030/3** renamed to **Shir 2**. The long name has been changed to **F.V.4030/3 | Shir 2**. "Shir 2" is written with the English spelling rather than a a transliterated form of شیر 2 with diacritics because the vehicle never actually made it to Iran and so only the British name, Shir 2, applies.
    - **SB2C-5** (Japan / Thailand) renamed to **B.J.3**. The long name has been changed to **Curtiss-Wright Corporation | Ekhrụxng Bin Jomtī Bæb Thī 3**.

    - **Rafale C (F3R)** renamed to **Rafale C (F4.1)**. This was done because with the new addition of the 2 extra missile pylons for the Rafale, it sufficiently resembles the F4.1 standard. Rafales have been able to carry 8 MICAs in testing since 2009, images exist from at least 2004 of French ones carrying 8 MICAs, and Indian F3R Rafales carry 8 MICAs operationally. That, combined with the Scorpion HMCS present on the ingame Rafale, makes it sufficiently resemble an F4.1 standard Rafale, albeit a neutered one.
    - **Su-33** renamed to **Su-33 (2016)**. This was done because it has CCRP meaning it has the SVP-24-33 navigation and strike package which was only introduced in 2016.

    - **152 mm XM150E6 gun/launcher** renamed to **Gun-Launcher, 152mm, XM150E6**.
    - **PTP86 100 háomi huátáng fǎn tankè pào** renamed to **PTP86 100 háomi huátáng fan tankè pào**. The original was correct, but the game does not render "ǎ" with that diacritic.

    - **K/PZS-01** renamed to **K/PZS01**.
    - **K/ADC03A** renamed to **K/JDC03A**. This does create an issue where the **JH7A**'s pod now has the wrong name because it uses the **K/ADC03A**'s text entry but has the model of the **K/PZS01**, but the **JH7A** is supposed to have the real **K/JDC03A** so I went with this.
    - **ASELPOD** renamed to **K/PZS01**. **ASELPOD** is a real thing, but ingame it has the model of the **K/PZS01**.
    - The **GBU-24/B**'s mass tag has been corrected to 1079.55 kg.

### Nations:

- #### Changes:

    - Removed the long nation names for the main nations. This means that if you hover over a nation like the USA, it will simply say "USA", rather than "United States of America". This does not apply to nations that don't have their own trees. For example, this would not happen to Finland, but it would to Sweden because Sweden is the name of the tree. This has been done to avoid a really annoying bug Gaijin introduced where if you enter a battle or test drive while in the research window, when you exit it, the nation names in the bottom bar become the length of the full ones and so a bunch of them are just cut off and inaccessible.

### Version:

        - Note: Some transliterations do not have the proper pinyin diacritics because the game cannot render them. For example, the **QJT86 7.62 háomi chēzai jīqiāng** should be the **QJT86 7.62 háomǐ chēzǎi jīqiāng**, but the game does not render the characters "ǐ" and "ǎ".

        - **105 mm WMA301 cannon** renamed to **ZPL1998A 105 háomi tankè pào**. I can't actually identify what the **WMA301**'s gun is, but it's supposedly a low recoil development of the **ZPL94** and considering that this is definitely not the **ZPL98**, the **ZPL98A** was all that was left. It appears to be a **ZPL98A** with a new sleeve.
        - **23 mm Type 23-3 cannon** renamed to **23-3 xíng 23 háomi hángkōng jīpào**.

    - **USS Tennessee (BB-43)** moved to the correct place in `units.csv`. This does not affect ingame naming.
    - The format for the dates of naval vehicles have changed. Instead of the previous format of "[class], [name], [date]," the date will now be formatted in parentheses and will only be present for vessels that have been refitted. For example, the **Admiral-class, HMS Hood (51), 1941** becomes the **Admiral-class, HMS Hood (51) (1941)** because it is in its 1941 refit, and the **Worcester-class, USS Roanoke (CL-145), 1949** becomes the **Worcester-class, USS Roanoke (CL-145)** because its 1949 fit was its fit when it was originally constructed, before any refits. Because this change applies to all vessels, I will not list every vessel it applies to. Instead, I will list all vessels that have lost their years due to being in their original configuration and all vessels that have had their year changed. Only US bluewater fleet vessels and the **HMS Hood (51)** have been moved over to this system (I tried to do every naval vehicle and I quickly realized how bad of an idea that was).

### General:

- #### Changes:

    - The mod's format has changed. Each file now only has the English entry, making the mod's files much more readable and reducing its file size. This was also done because it is an English mod. The exception to this is `userlang.csv` because that file is meant for all of your custom edits and so all the language headers have been kept in it, as well as the missing Vietnamese header being added to it (this was, in fact, a last minute decision I made the night before this update's release).
    - A full review of the game's texts has been conducted. All game texts have been moved over to use gender-neutral language. This means that, unless a specific historical figure is being referenced, all gendered language will be changed to use the they/them/their/theirs/themself pronoun set. Other pieces of text that do not contain gendered pronouns but could reasonably be interpreted as gendered language will be reworked to be gender-neutral. If you have a problem with gender-neutral/inclusive language, please delete this mod from your computer and kindly piss off because you are not welcome here.

        - **SD-10(A) air-to-air missiles** renamed to **SD10A**.
        - **Drop tank (600 gal.)** renamed to **Drop tank (600 gal)**. I could not find an actual name for it, this is just a consistency change to match the rest of the mod.
        - **Drop tank (2000 liters.)** renamed to **Drop tank (2000 L)**. I could not find an actual name for it, this is just a consistency change to match the rest of the mod.
        - **Drop tank (800 liters.)** renamed to **Drop tank (800 L)**. I could not find an actual name for it, this is just a consistency change to match the rest of the mod.
        - **Drop tank (1100 liters.)** renamed to **Drop tank (1100 L)**. I could not find an actual name for it, this is just a consistency change to match the rest of the mod.
        - **90 mm T7 cannon** renamed to **Gun, 90mm, T7**.
        - **Large caliber countermeasures belt** renamed to **50 mm countermeasures**. I have to do a full review of CMs later because split CMs made everything weird.
        - **Flz Lwf 63 air-to-air missiles** renamed to **Flz.Lwf. LL 63**.
        - **Flz.Lwf. LB 82 air-to-air missiles** renamed to **Flz.Lwf. LB 82**.

        - **LS-6 250** renamed to **LS6**.
        - **LS-6 500** renamed to **LS6** (this and the 250 kg one have different mass tags).
    - **7.7 mm Type 92 machinegun** renamed to **7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun**. This is not an actual rename, it is just a spelling correction.
    - **7.7 mm Type 89 machinegun** renamed to **7.7 mm Type 89 machine gun**. This is not an actual rename, it is just a spelling correction.
    - **Type 81 Tan-SAM Launcher** renamed to **81 shiki tankyorichi taikū yūdōdan Tan-SAM ranchā "Shōtoarō"**.
    - **BMB-GPS** type tag renamed to **BMB-GNSS**.
    - The **76 mm** caliber tag has been changed to **76.2 mm**. Pretty much all of these guns are 76.2 mm in caliber because that is 3 inches converted to metric. If any of them are not 76.2 mm, please inform me.

### Engines:

- #### Additions:

    - Update "Dance of Dragons" additions:
        - **Mitsubishi 10ZF 22WT**
        - **8VA 34WTK**

        - **10ZF 22WT**
        - **8VA 34WTK**

- #### Changes:

    - Update "Dance of Dragons" changes:

        - **Mitsubishi 10ZF 22WT** renamed to **10ZF 22WT**.

### Maps:

- #### Changes:

    - *Three Gorges** renamed back to the original name of **Mysterious Valley**. I have decided against changing map names (e.g. in one dev built of 1.09.00, **Eastern Europe** was renamed to **Ukrainian Town** because it is in Ukraine) beyond redoing their formatting. You can always change this if you want in the `WTHLM_userlang.csv` file.

### Sensors:

A new sensors file has been added. This file contains game sensors and radars. Radar names will be reworked over time. Not all radar names will be reworked in this update (the Soviet weapon rework drained me too much for another rework). More of the names would've been updated in this patch because originally this was meant to be 1.08.70 and was supposed to come out before Dance of Dragons, but I felt burnt out and didn't work much on it, and then Dance of Dragons happened and I got preoccupied with that.

    - The streak called "The last man standing!" has been renamed to "The Last One Standing!" in order to use gender-neutral language. A full review of the game's texts to bring them all over to gender-neutral language is planned for a later date (Russian stuff has been driving me far too insane for me to go on another large rework project).

    - **Stalingradskij Traktornyj Zavod im. F.È. Dzyeržinskogo** added as the manufacturer for the following vehicles:

    - Russian rework:
        - **Neustrashimy** renamed to **Nyeustrašimyj**.
        - **Stroyny** renamed to **Strojnyj**.
        - **Kharrikeyna F.B. MK-IIb (ShVAK)** renamed to **Kharrikeyna F.B. MK-IIb (ŠVAK)**.
        - **TKA No. 12/5 (ShVAK-20)** renamed to **TKA No. 12/5 (ŠVAK-20)**.
        - **GAZ-AAA (DShK)** renamed to **GAZ-AAA (DŠKT)**.
        - **T-60** renamed to **T-60 (1942)**. The long name has remaine the same. This is because we have the later production **T-60** with increased armor from 1942.
        - **T-34 (1942) / E STZ** folder renamed to **T-34 (Sep 1942) / (Èkranirovannyj)**.
        - **T-34 (1940) / (1941)** folder renamed to **T-34 (Dec 1940) / (May 1941)**.
        - **KV-1 (1940) / 2 (1939)** folder renamed to **KV-1 (Feb 1940) / 2 (Jan 1940)**
        - **KV-1 (1941) / 85** folder renamed to **KV-1 (Jul 1941) / 85**.
        - **SU-152 / 85 / ISU-152** folder renamed to **SU-152 (Mar 1943) / 85 / ISU-152**.
        - **2S1 / 3** folder renamed to **2S1 / 3M**.
        - **ZiS-12 / 43** folder renamed to **ZiS-12 (94-KM) / ZSU-37**
        - **ZSU-37-2** long name changed from **ZSU-37-2 Yenisei** to **ZSU-37-2 "Yenisyej"**.
        - **ASU-57** renamed to **ASU-57 (1954)** to distinguish it from the earlier model using the **Č-51** cannon. The long name has been changed to **Ob"yekt 572 | ASU-57 obr. 1954 g.**.
        - **2S38** long name changed from **2S38 "Derivatsiya-PVO** to **2S38 "Dyerivacziâ-PVO"**.
        - All the T-34s, KV-1s, and KV-2s have been reworked. Beyond making their long names more accurate, their dating system has been standardized. Their long names have the standard obr. dates, but they also have, in parentheses, the month and year they were made. This is because T-34, KV-1, and KV-2 variants saw several minor modifications within a single year and those need to be differentiated. In the short names, that month and date is included in paretheses instead of the obr. date. For variants such as the T-34s with the 57 mm ZiS-4 cannon, the long name includes the month and date of the base vehicle that is being modifided, followed by the modification, and then followed by the month and year of the modification. This is to make it clear what variant is being modified and when this modification happened. The short names include the date of the base variant because that is more useful to see in a short name. This is not a standardized system across the entire mod. It was needed specifically for the T-34s, KV-1s, and KV-2s. The list of changes is as follows (this drove me so insane that I never want to see the characters "T", "-", "3", and "4" in that order ever again) (all folders have been adjusted accordingly):
            - **T-34 (Sep 1942) (ZiS-4)** renamed to **T-34 (Sep, 1942) (ZiS-4M)**. The long name has been changed to **Ural'skij Tankovyj Zavod, Zavod №183 | Ob"yekt 34 | T-34 obr. 1942 g. (September, 1942) (ZiS-4M) (July, 1943)**.
            - **T-34 (May 1941) (ZiS-4)** renamed to **T-34 (May, 1941) (ZiS-4)**. The long name has been changed to **Stalingradskij Traktornyj Zavod im. F.È. Dzyeržinskogo | Ob"yekt 34 | T-34 obr. 1941 g. (May, 1941) (ZiS-4)**. I cannot find date of ZiS-4 modification. It is in late 1941, but I cannot find the date.
            - **T-34 (Èkranirovannyj) (Feb 1942)** renamed to **T-34 (Èkranirovannyj) (STZ)**. The long name has been changed to **Stalingradskij Traktornyj Zavod im. F.È. Dzyeržinskogo | Ob"yekt 34 | T-34 obr. 1941 g. (Èkranirovannyj) (February, 1942)**.

(Èkranirovannyj) (February, 1943)**. This "Èkranirovannyj" model is from February of 1943, but it is a modification of a 1941 model T-34 manufactured by Zavod №112.
            - **T-34 (Jul 1941) (1-â Gv.T.Br.)** renamed to **T-34 (Jul, 1941) (1-â Gv.T.Br.)**. The long name has been changed to **Khar'kovskij Parovozostroityel'nyj Zavod, Zavod №183 | Ob"yekt 34 | T-34 obr. 1941 g. (July, 1941) (1-â Gvardyejskaâ Tankovaâ Brigada)**.
            - **T-34 (May 1941)** renamed to **T-34 (May, 1941)**. The long name has been changed to **Ural'skij Tankovyj Zavod, Zavod №183 | Ob"yekt 34 | T-34 obr. 1941 g. (May, 1941)**.

    - **F-14A-GR** (Iran) renamed to **F14**. This is based off 3 different posters that call it the **F14**, at least 2 of which are from different events, and the *supposedly* official IRIAF website which calls it the **F14** in the title of articles, but the **F-14** in the text of the articles. If y'all have better sources, please send them.

### Modifications:

- #### Changes:

    - **1V528-1 + 1G46 / TShU-1 + 1-11** modification renamed to **1V528-1 + 1G46 / TŠU-1 + 1-11**.
    - **OTShU-1-7** electro-optical active protection system renamed to **OTŠU-1-7**.
    - **AIM-9P-1** modification renamed to **AIM-9P-3** to match the weapon rename in 1.08.68.

### Engines:

- #### Changes:

    - Russian transliteration changes:
        - **ASh-62** engine renamed to **AŠ-62**. This was supposed to have been done in 1.08.68 and was listed in the changelog for it, but it somehow did not get changed.
        - **ASh-73TK** engine renamed to **AŠ-73TK**.
        - **ASH-73** engine renamed to **AŠ-73**.
        - **ASH-82V** engine renamed to **AŠ-82V**.

### Nations:

- #### Changes:

    - The transliterated long form of the **USSR**'s name has been changed to match the new transliteration standard. It has been changed from **Soyuz Sovyetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik** to **Soûz Sovyetskikh Soczialističyeskikh Ryespublik**.

## 1.08.68 - 17-08-2024

A new transliteration standard has been introduced for Russian. This standard is a modified version of GOST 7.79-2000 A (ISO 9). Not all Russian vehicles, engines, and weapons have been updated in this patch. Doing so would be a monumental task to take on soon before a new game update comes out, so Russian vehicles will be switched over to this new system over time.

### Vehicles:

- #### Changes:

    - The **S.M.79 B (1936)** (Italy and Germany) has had the Romanian roundel added to it.
    - "-BH" removed from the mid distance name of the **XA-38** for formatting consistency.
    - **M10 GMC** (USA, China, and France) long name changed from **3-inch Gun Motor Carriage M10** to **Carriage, Motor, 3-inch Gun, M10**.
    - **M18 GMC** (USA and China) long name changed from **M18 Gun Motor Carriage** to **Carriage, Motor, 76mm Gun, M18**.
    - **M18 GMC (805th TD.Bat.)** long name changed from **M18 Gun Motor Carriage (805th Tank Destroyer Battalion) "Black Cat"** to **Carriage, Motor, 76mm Gun, M18 (805th Tank Destroyer Battalion) "Black Cat"**.
    - **M18 GMC (M3)** long name changed from **90 mm Gun Motor Carriage, M18 "Super Hellcat"** to **Carriage, Motor, 90mm Gun, M18 "Super Hellcat"**.
    - **M8 HMC** (USA and China) long name changed from **75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8** to **Carriage, Motor, 75mm Howitzer, M8 "Scott"**.
    - **M8A1 GMC** long name changed from **75 mm Gun Motor Carriage M8A1** to **Carriage, Motor, 75mm Gun, M8A1 "Scott"**.
    - **M8 LAC** (USA and China) long name changed from **Light Armored Car M8** to **Car, Armored, Light, M8**.
    - **M3 GMC** long name changed from **75 mm Gun Motor Carriage M3** to **Carriage, Motor, 75mm Gun, M3**. The distance name has been changed from **75 mm M3** to **M3 GMC**.
    - **M22** long name changed from **Light Tank M22 Locust** to **Tank, Light, M22 Locust**.
    - **M24** (China) long name changed from **Light Tank M24 Chaffee** to **Tank, Light, M24 Chaffee**. This change had been made to the American **M24** long ago but I had forgotten to change the Chinese one.
    - **M36 GMC** (USA and China) long name changed from **90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36** to **Carriage, Motor, 90mm Gun, M36 "Jackson"**.
    - **M36B2** (USA, Japan, and France) long name changed from **90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36B2** to **Carriage, Motor, 90mm Gun, M36B2 "Jackson"**. The short name has been changed to **M36B2 GMC**. The Japanese one will definitely be changed again later when I do a rework of the non-WWII Japanese ground tree.
    - The roundel for the Iranian **F-14A** has been changed to the emblem seen on Iran's flag (I didn't realize this emblem was in the game which is why it hadn't been changed initially). The name has also been changed from **F-14A** to **F-14A-GR**.
    - **M103** long name changed from **120 mm Gun Tank M103** to **Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 120mm Gun, M103**.

        - **Yasser**
        - **Sedjil**
        - **Fakour-90**

- #### Changes:

    - **75 mm Type II Model I cannon** renamed to **shisei 5 shiki 7.5 senchi sensha hō (naga) I gata** (I don't know why Japan used Roman numerals here and nowhere else, but I also don't care).

### Engines:

- #### Additions:

    - **Continental Motors Company** added as the manufacturer for the **Sholef V1**'s **AVDS-1790-5A** engine. I had to do this in an mildly irritating way because this is the only engine in the game that does have a model name but not a manufacturer, but it'll work the same regardless.

### Nations:

- #### Changes:

    - The color tags for the slash in between a nation's 2 names have been removed. This means that, when hovering over a vehicle's flag in the hanger to see the operator nation and research nation, the slash will now just be white, not gray. I would have liked it to stay gray, but the service record filter showed the color tags instead of the color, so I removed it.

## 1.08.66 - 30-07-2024

### General:

- #### Changes:

    - The mod format has changed. You now just add the new files, which are all named `WTHLM_[something].csv`, and the only file you need to replace is `localization.blk`, which will get the game to read all of those files. I did absolutely just yoink this system from IFN1's lang mod because the second I found out you could do this, I was like, "Holy shit this makes my life so much easier! I don't need to stuff all my extra stuff into `_common_languages.csv` and I can keep the original files in the game while getting the game to read my new ones."
        - The new file `WTHLM_userlang.csv` can be used to add your own edits. It is last in the load order so any changes you make in it will override all the other files. This allows you to add any of your own edits to any text ingame.

### Vehicles:

- #### Additions:

    - Added **21 kaigun kōkūshō** as the manufacturer for the **J2M4 Kai**.
    - Added **Soltam Systems** as the manufacturer for the **Sholef V1**.

- #### Changes:

    - All Japanese vessels have had "IJN" removed from their names. These names are commonly written with "IJN", but no historical documentation supports this nomenclature.
    - All Italian vessels have had "RN" removed from their names. No historical documentation supports this nomenclature and it's not even commonly written. Gaijin just made this one up.
    - The **JAS 39 A** has been changed to the **JAS 39 A (Cobra)** due to having the Cobra HMDS.
    - The **JAS 39 C** has been changed to the **JAS 39 C (Cobra)** due to having the Cobra HMDS.
    - The South African **Gripen C** has been changed to the **Gripen C (Cobra)** due to having the Cobra HMDS.

    - **B-17E (late)** long name changed to **B-17E Flying Fortress (Sperry No. 645849-J)**.
    - Japanese air rework (all folders have been adjusted accordingly) (I thank Wiggly_Armed_Man so much for helping with this, I would have died without him helping me on this and answering my questions, especially on whatever the hell that shi kō/otsu/hatsu/whatever system is):
        - "kō", "otsu", "hei", and "tei" are no longer capitalized. "kai" is no longer capitalized, but only when it is not part of a vehicle's proper name (e.g. the **Ki 45 Kai** is now the **Ki 45 kai**, but the **Kikka Kai** stays as is (well, the **Kikka Kai** was also changed but in a different way)).
        - The **F-86F-30 / 40** folder has recieved its missing roundel.

        - **E7K2** long name changed to **94 shiki suijō teisatsuki 2 gata | E7K2** (the **E7K2** is the Japanese ship-launched floatplane).
        - **Ki 48-II Otsu** long name changed to **99 shiki sōhatsu kei bakugekiki 2 gata otsu | Ki 48-II otsu**.
        - **B5N2** long name changed to **97 shiki kanjō kōgekiki 12 gata | B5N2**.
        - **Ki 43-I** long name changed to **1 shiki sentōki 1 gata hei | Ki 43-I hei "Hayabusa"**. The short name has been changed to **Ki 43-I hei**.
        - **Ki 43-II** (USA and Japan) long name changed to **1 shiki sentōki 2 gata kō | Ki 43-II kō "Hayabusa"**. The short name has been changed to **Ki 43-II kō**.
        - **Ki 43-III Otsu** long name changed to **1 shiki sentōki 3 gata otsu | Ki 43-III otsu "Hayabusa"**.
        - **Ki 43-III Kō** long name changed to **1 shiki sentōki 3 gata kō | Ki 43-III kō "Hayabusa"** (this is the **Ki 43-III kō** in the Chinese tree).
        - **Ki 49-I** long name changed to **100 shiki jū bakugekiki 1 gata | Ki 49-I "Donryu"**.
        - **Ki 49-II Kō** long name changed to **100 shiki jū bakugekiki 2 gata kō | Ki 49-II kō "Donryu"**.

        - **Ki 49-II Otsu (late)** long name changed to **100 shiki jū bakugekiki 2 gata otsu | Ki 49-II otsu "Donryu" (late)**.
        - **Ki 67-I Kō** long name changed to **4 shiki jū bakugekiki 1 gata kō | Ki 67-I kō "Hiryū"**.
        - **Ki 67-I Otsu** long name changed to **4 shiki jū bakugekiki 1 gata otsu | Ki 67-I otsu "Hiryū"**.
        - **R2Y2-J** long name changed to **shisei Keiun Kai rikujō kōgekiki 11 gata | R2Y2-G**. The short name has changed to **R2Y2-G (11 gata)**.
        - **R2Y2-Ja** long name changed to **shisei Keiun Kai rikujō kōgekiki 22 gata | R2Y2-G**. The short name has changed to **R2Y2-G (22 gata)**.
        - **R2Y2-Jb** long name changed to **shisei Keiun Kai rikujō kōgekiki 32 gata | R2Y2-G**. The short name has changed to **R2Y2-G (32 gata)**. The short version of this story is that none of the R2Y2s were real. The 11 gata was basically a napkin drawing, and the 22 gata and 32 gata are entirely fictional, so none of them ever had any form of official name beyond "Keiun Kai" for the general R2Y2 program. However, going by the how the 1943 Japanese designation scheme works, this is most likely what it would have gotten called during its prototype phase (calling it anything resembling a production phase would be even more ridiculous than this already is).
        - **Kikka Kai** renamed to **shisei Kikka Kai rikujō sentōki 21 gata kō | M7N1-J kō**. It's a long story (but you're getting used to that by now). Basically, the version of the **Kikka** we have ingame is a planned fighter variant with **Ne-20 kai** engines and 2 **Type 5** cannons. The **Kikka** also falls under the post-1943 naval aviation designation scheme, meaning that for the model, the first digit represents an engine change and the second digit represents an airframe change. Armament changes are denoted with "kō", "otsu", "hei", and "tei". The ingame **Kikka** was buffed years ago so its engines have the performance of the **Ne-20 kai**, even though they weren't renamed (the **Ne-20** has been renamed to the **Ne-20 kai** in this update though), and it has the **Type 5** cannon. So it is this planned fighter version. The names **M7N** and **M8N** are the options for what the **Kikka**'s shortform name could have been. J9N and J9Y are both incorrect. What the name was has been lost, but these are the options. One of them was the **Kikka**, and the other was the Fujihana, but we aren't sure which was which. However, the **Kikka** was likely ordered earlier and was definitely built earlier because multiple **Kikka** airframes were in varying stages of construction, including 1 full prototype, while the Fujihana never left the drawing board. These naval shortform designations (e.g. **B6N**, **G8N**, **J5N**, etc.) were usually assigned upon the vehicle being built. Given that the **Kikka** was built and the Fujihana never left the drawing board, the name **M7N** would likely have been the name for the Kikka, rather than the later **M8N**.
        - **J8M1** removed from the long name of the **Ki 200**. I know I literally just added this last patch, but the **J8M1** and the **Ki 200** had slightly different dimensions and guns. Couldn't get concrete stuff on the ingame one's dimensions, but the guns are that of the **Ki 200**. The long name of the **Ki 200** has been changed to **shisei Shūsui | Ki 200**.
        - **B7A2 Ryusei** renamed to **shisei Ryūsei kanjō kōgekiki | B7A1**.
        - **B7A2 (Homare 23) Ryusei** renamed to **shisei Ryūsei Kai kanjō kōgekiki | B7A2**. It's a long story but basically, what is translated as **B7A2** in English is actually the **B7A1**, and the **B7A2 (Homare 23)**, of which only 1 was built, is actually the **B7A2**, with only 1 **B7A2** prototype ever being built.

    - The **M7N1-J kō**'s **Otsu mod.** modification has been renamed to **Type 5 x2** because it just gives you an extra **Type 5** cannon, bringing the total to 2. **M7N1-J kō** is already a very shakey name (not that we have a better one), but it at least fits with what it would have been called to the best of our knowledge/guesstimation. The name "otsu" for any piece of this thing is even more fake though.

### Engines:

- #### Additions:

    - Adding missing text for the **Sholef V1**'s **AVDS-1790-5A** engine.

- #### Changes:

    - The **Ne-20** engine has been renamed to the **Ne-20 kai** because it has the performance of that variant.

## 1.08.65 - 24-07-2024

### General:

- #### Changes:

    - All loading screens with vehicle names in their name have been adjusted to use the vehicles' proper names and to ensure consistent formatting across all of them. I know this seems like a small change, but the game has 177 loading screens and I went insane doing this.

### Vehicles:

- #### Additions:

    - Updated for the Skilled Marksman Battle Pass season and the Flight of the Albatross event.
    - **Sikorsky Aircraft Corperation / Elbit Systems / Israeli Air Force** added as the manufacturer for the **AH-60**.

    - Long name of the **Ki 200** changed from **Ki 200 Shusui** to **J8M1 | Ki 200 Shūsui**
    - **AH-60** renamed to **Yanshuf Hamush**. Its long long story, but the short version is that the Sikorsky Armed Black Hawk Demonstrator, while similar, is not the same vehicle. The Yanshuf Hamush was developed from the ABH Demonstrator by a combination of teams from the Sikorsky Aircraft Corperation, Elbit Systems, and the Israeli Air Force. I nor anyone I know has been able to find an actual name for it so **Yanshuf Hamush**, its nickname, is the best we have. If you can find an actual name, please report it.
    - **AH-1G** long name changed from **AH-1G Tzefa** to **AH-1G Tzefa Alef**.
    - **AH-1Q** long name changed from **AH-1Q Tzefa** to **AH-1Q Tzefa Bet**.

    - **Saraph** short name changed to **AH-64D-I**. The long name has been changed from **Boeing Rotorcraft Systems | Saraph** to **Boeing Rotorcraft Systems | AH-64D-I Saraph**.
    - **MD 500/Orev** long name changed from **MD 500/Orev Defender "Lahatut"** to **MD 500/Orev Lahatut**.
    - **Rooivalk Mk1F** renamed to **Rooivalk Mk. 1F**.
    - "Alcione" added to the long name of the **Z.1007bis III** and **Z.1007bis V**.
    - **Alcione** (the ship, not the **Z.1007bis**) renamed to **Alcione (F 544)**. The long name has been changed from **Albatross-class, Alcione F544** to **Albatross-class, Alcione (F 544)**.
    - The short name of the **Sholef** has been changed to the **Sholef V1**.
    - **PBM-5A "Mariner"** renamed to **PBM-5A Mariner**. The short name has been changed to the **PBM-5A**.
    - The **PBM-3** has been moved in the files to match the reorganization of the US air tree. I had forgotten to do this earlier. This has no affect ingame, but does make `units.csv` more organized.
    - "Cobra" added to the long names of the **AH-1F** and **AH-1G**.
    - **Schützenpanzer lang Typ 12-3 mit 105mm Leichtgeschütz M40A1** renamed to **Schützenpanzer lang Typ 12-3 mit 106mm Leichtgeschütz M 40 A1**. The short name has been changed to **SPz 12-3 (LGs M 40 A1).
    - Roundel removed from the **VBCI 2 (MCT-30)**.
    - **M247** given the name "Sergeant York" in its long name.
    - "Cicogna" added to the long names of the **BR.20 BR** and **BR.20M M1**.
    - **Challenger 1** folder changed from **Challenger Mk. 2 / 3** to **Challenger 1, Mk. 2 / 3** to match the names of the vehicles in it.

    - The **155 mm Soltam M839 cannon** has been renamed to the **Model 839P**.
    - The caliber and type tag has been added to the **Model 839P** howitzer.
    - Renamed the **305 mm Mk.4 depth charge** to the **305 mm Mk. 4 depth charge**. It'll get a proper rename later but right now it's just to fit with the rest of the mod's formatting.
    - the **HWZ** tag has been changed to **CNN-HWZ**.
    - **Rb 05 A** renamed to **Rb 05A**.

    - The "AFC" modification has been moved to after the vehicle's name in the long name for the **A-4E (AFC 418-II)** (USA and Israel) and the **A-4E (AFC 482)**.

    - Every Japanese "Ki-" plane (including ones captured by other countries) has been changed from "Ki-" to "Ki " because Japanese writing does not use the "-" character and that appears to be to be a postwar addition in English.

        - **Ki 43-II** (USA)

        - **Ki 109**
        - **Ki 108 Kai**
    - **IS-4M** corrected to have **Ob"yekt 701-6** in its long name. This was done to the tutorial **IS-4M**, but I forgot to do it to the standard tech tree one.
    - **T-2(K)** renamed to **T-2 (late)**
    - **T-2(K) (conversion)** renamed to **T-2 (late) (ADTW)**. It's an annoying story and I don't want to talk about it.

    - **MiG-23ML** changed from **Izdeliye 23-12** to **Izdeliye 23-12A**. This was supposed to be done in 1.08.60, but there was a typo and I only wrote "12" instead of "12A".

## 1.08.59 - 01-07-2024

### General:

- #### Changes:

    - Changed the color of the "War Tinder's Lang Mod [version]" text to match the color of the text right above it listing how many players are online.

### Vehicles:

- #### Additions:

    - Added **Cadillac Motor Car Division** as the manufacturer for the **M551** and **M551 (M32A1)**.

- #### Changes:

    - The **Torpedo-Schnellboot, Libelle-Klasse, Projekt 131.400** has been renamed to **kleines Torpedoschnellboot Projekt 131 "Libelle" | Nr. 401**. The short name has been adjusted to **Nr. 401** accordingly.
    - Missing **KPz** added to the short name of the **Leopard 2 A7 HU**.
    - The **M4** from the War Thunder Mobile promotion has been changed over to use the **Tank, Medium** nomenclature. This was missed in 1.08.56 when the rest of the M4s were switched over to use this nomenclature.
    - **leichter Kampfpanzer M 41** changed to **leichter Kampfpanzer M 41 G**. The short name was already **M 41 G**, but the "G" was missing in the long name.
    - The long name of the **Project 89.2UR, Bernau (343)** has been changed to **Projekt 89.2 UR, Bernau (343), 1985**. This will probably be changed back at a later date when I do a review of naval formatting as a whole, but for now, it has been changed to fit with the format of all other vessels in the game.
    - The long name of the **Flakträger Krischan der Große (1943)** has been changed to **Flakträger Krischan der Große, 1943**. This will probably be changed back at a later date when I do a review of naval formatting as a whole, but for now, it has been changed to fit with the format of all other vessels in the game.
    - **Panzerjäger I / Sd.Kfz. 251/10** folder renamed to **Pz.Jgr. I / m.S.P.W. D (7,5cm K.)** to match the short names of the vehicles.
    - Seperator removed from the long name of the **Vextra 105** because GIAT Industries named it the **Vextra 105** while the French Army never had a name for it because it never adopted it.
    - **Flugabwehrraketenradwagen 1 A2 Roland auf Lkw 15t mil gl Kat 1A1** renamed to **Flugabwehrraketenradwagen 1 A2 Roland auf Lkw 15t mil gl Kat 1 A1**.
    - The **Super AMX 30** has been corrected to use the **Engin principal de combat** nomenclature. The other **AMX 30**s had it, but the **Super AMX 30** was missing it.

        - **BGM-71 TOW** renamed to **Launcher, Tubular, Guided Missile, M220A2, Dual Launcher**. This is NOT the **BGM-71 TOW** missile. This is the **M3A3 CFV**'s launcher that Gaijin has called the **BGM-71 TOW** instead of the name of the launcher. The missile has stayed the same.
