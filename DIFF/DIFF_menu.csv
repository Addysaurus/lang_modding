info/material/hasSpallLiner;Spall liner
info/material/hasSpallLiner/tooltip;Aramid fabric or ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene panels installed in the crew compartments of armored vehicles reduce the angle and velocity of fragments, significantly improving crew and equipment protection from small fragments generated during armor penetration.
info/material/hasNBCLiner;Anti-radiation liner
info/material/hasNBCLiner/tooltip;Panels made of polyethylene and polyisobutylene are installed inside and outside the tank. Their primary purpose is to reduce the impact on the crew during a nuclear explosion, but in some cases they can also protect the crew and equipment from small fragments generated during armor penetration by reducing their velocity and angle of flight, although this is less effective than a specialized spall liner.
info/material/hasCompositeArmor;Composite armor
info/material/hasCompositeArmor/tooltip;Armor protection is made using composite armor, which can consist of multiple layers of dissimilar materials, such as textolite, ceramic elements, NERA layers, and other armor materials. This approach provides a lighter weight than standard steel armor while maintaining the same resistance. For main battle tanks, composite armor is typically used in the most heavily protected frontal areas of the hull and turret.
info/material/hasAluminiumArmor;Aluminum armor
info/material/hasAluminiumArmor/tooltip;Armor protection is manufactured partially or entirely using aluminum alloys. Aluminum armor provides a reduction in armor weight compared to homogeneous steel armor of the same resistance. The armor resistance of aluminum depends on the manufacturing technology and alloying elements used in its production.
info/material/hasSteelArmor;Steel armor
info/material/hasSteelArmor/tooltip;Armor protection is made using steel armor plates. The projectile resistance of armor steel depends on the manufacturing technology. Rolled armor has higher armor resistance than cast armor due to the uniform distribution of defects during the rolling process. Certain types of steel, such as electroslag remelted steel and high-hardness steel, offer greater resistance than conventional steel armor.
info/material/hasNoArmor;Without armor
info/material/hasNoArmor/tooltip;There is no armor protection, the vehicle is made of non-armored materials and is not designed to be under enemy fire.
info/material/bullet_proof_lite;Bullet proof

info/material/projectile_proof_medium;Projectile proof
info/material/projectile_proof_medium/tooltip;Projectile-proof armor is designed to protect a combat vehicle from tank and anti-tank gunfire. For medium and main battle tanks, this typically means providing projectile-proof protection from the front, while the sides and rear are often significantly less protected.
info/material/projectile_proof_heavy;Projectile proof
info/material/projectile_proof_heavy/tooltip;Projectile-proof armor is designed to protect a combat vehicle from tank and anti-tank gunfire. For heavy tanks, this typically means the ability to withstand fire from more powerful guns than medium tanks, or over a wider range of frontal arc.
info/material/projectile_proof_sau;Projectile proof
info/material/projectile_proof_sau/tooltip;Projectile-proof armor is designed to protect a combat vehicle from tank and anti-tank gunfire.
info/material/splinter_proof_rocket;Fragment proof
info/material/splinter_proof_rocket/tooltip;Spall armor is designed to protect a combat vehicle from shell and rocket fragments in the event of an indirect hit.
