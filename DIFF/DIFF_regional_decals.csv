decals/cn_3rd_fg_cacw_decal;3rd FG Emblem, CACW
decals/cn_3rd_fg_cacw_decal/desc;Emblem of the 3rd Fighter Group, Chinese-American Composite Wing. The 3rd Group formed on October 1st, 1943, flying the P-40N before transitioning to the P-51C, D, and K in 1945. This quintessential group emblem depicts an eagle silhouetted against the roundel of the ROC, gripping a red sun in its talons. It was most commonly seen as the group's uniform patch, though it was occasionally painted in more artistic detail as well.
decals/fr_invulnerable_inscription_decal;"""L'Invulnérable"" Inscription"
decals/fr_invulnerable_inscription_decal/desc;"L'Invulnérable (The Invulnerable) inscription, French Army. France has a particularly long history of naming its military equipment, with that practice extending to their tanks in World War Two — with almost every tank bearing a unique name. These names were often typical; most common were towns and cities, feminine names, and power words or phrases. This inscription — perhaps quite optimistically — was painted along the right side of the upper hull on an H.35 in 1940."
decals/il_366_armored_decal;366th Armored Division Emblem
decals/il_366_armored_decal/desc;"Emblem of the 366th (Reserve) Armored Division, IDF. The Division was formed on October 6th, 1973, and would be restructured and renamed several times. It would go on to include several armored, infantry and artillery battalions. The armored divisions in particular were equipped with various modifications of the Merkava, including the Mk.2, Mk.3, and Mk.4. The emblem depicts a tank cresting a mountain ridge, emblematic of the division’s location around the Golan Heights. The bright red background is likely a reference to the nickname of the division, ""Netiv Ha-Esh"", or ""Path of Fire"". The emblem most commonly took the form of a pin or shoulder badge and was rarely if ever applied to armored vehicles as a marking. It could be seen until 2014, when the division disbanded."
decals/it_dragaggio_emblem_decal;"""Dragaggio"" Emblem"
decals/it_dragaggio_emblem_decal/desc;"Dragaggio (Dredging) badge, Italian Navy. This award was issued to distinguished dredging and minesweeper units in the latter stages of World War Two, awarded for both minelaying and mine removal operations around coastal Italy. It appeared in several variations, including a silver version and variants with the text ""Dragamine"" (Minesweeper) in place of ""Dragaggio"". The creature in the emblem appears to be a mix of a shark and a dolphin, with a dolphin-like tail fluke and shark-like fin arrangement — likely just intending to depict a general aggressive looking sea creature rather than a specific one."
decals/ussr_victor_of_berlin_decal;"""Victor of Berlin"" Inscription"
decals/ussr_victor_of_berlin_decal/desc;"""Victor of Berlin"" Inscription, Soviet Army. After World War Two, many Soviet tanks were painted with celebratory slogans and commemorative names, and were commonly displayed around military areas to showcase past triumphs and inspire new recruits. This marking was positioned on the left side of the turret on a T-34-85 stationed in Berlin after the war ended. The exact vehicle likely belonged to the 54th Guards Tank Brigade, but as these commemorative tanks were often repainted with only faint outlines of previous divisional markings visible, it is difficult to confirm conclusively."

decals/uk_baldys_bus_inscription_decal/desc;"""Baldy’s Bus"" Inscription, 18th Armoured Regiment, New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Typical with Kiwi military culture, it was often common for more humorous motifs and markings to be found on their vehicles, with this inscription being a great example. The scrawling was positioned on the front left reinforcement block on the hull side of a Sherman IB of B Squadron, stationed in Trieste during 1945. There’s little mystery behind the marking, with the commander of the Sherman (Number 15), exhibiting a considerable lack of hair. "
decals/fr_le_malin_badge_decal;Le Malin Badge
decals/fr_le_malin_badge_decal/desc;"One of several badges of the Destroyer Le Malin, French Navy. The French Navy was relatively light on markings and emblems, with personal motifs and graffiti being frowned upon. Specific ships often had badges and insignia however, with Le Malin having several iterations of the same design. This early variant of the ship’s badge takes the form of an ""Old French"" shield with a more square shape and a rounded, pointed bottom in ""paly"" style (small vertical stripes). The primary subject matter of course is the red monkey atop the anchor — likely a reference to the French saying, ""Malin comme un singe"" or, ""Clever like a monkey"""
decals/de_4th_23rd_recon_decal;4.(H)/23 Emblem
decals/de_4th_23rd_recon_decal/desc;The emblem of 4. Staffel (Heer) / Aufklärungsgruppe 23 (4th tactical reconnaissance flight of the 23rd Reconnaissance Squadron), Luftwaffe. The squadron was formed in May of 1939, and hopped between various theatres and campaigns, attaching to many army groups to perform reconnaissance. Initially forming with He 45 and He 46 recon aircraft, they would move on to the Hs 126 in December, before transferring to the Bf 109 G on July 31st 1943. The emblem depicts a rabbit on an artillery shell, likely a reference to the joint effort between the army and the recon group, with the rabbit symbolically guiding the shell. The emblem was most commonly positioned on both sides of the nose on the aircraft in operation with the squadron.
decals/it_la_spacca_inscription_decal;"""O LA VA O LA SPACCA"" Inscription"
decals/it_la_spacca_inscription_decal/desc;"""O la va o la spacca"" inscription, Polizia dell'Africa Italiana (Italian African Police.) Directly translated, the inscription reads ""Either it goes or it breaks"", but contextually a more idiomatic translation would be ""All or Nothing"", ""Sink or Swim"", or ""Now or Never."" The PAI were a light military force rarely engaging in heavy conflict, though they supported the core Italian military against the Commonwealth in Ethiopia and Libya. They operated the AB41 armored car which routinely took part in desert patrols, making the inscription quite a fitting reflection of their often fast and risky operations. The marking was positioned on several AB41 units, and could be seen above the drivers hatch on the front plate. "
decals/ru_shitov_lion;Personal Marking of Yuri Shitov, 9IAP-ChF
decals/ru_shitov_lion/desc;"The personal Marking of Lt. Yuri Pavlovich Shitov, 9 IAP-ChF (9th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Black Sea Fleet), Soviet Air Force. Yuri had a particularly turbulent time in the Air Force, being denied the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for hooliganism. Despite this, Yuri proved himself to be a very capable pilot, scoring 15 aerial victories with 2 of them being shared. He piloted the I-153 and would finish the war in the Yak-9, with which he scored the majority of his victories. During 1943 however he would fly the LaGG-3, in this time his personal ""Lionheart"" marking could be found on the right side of the fuselage, behind and below the cockpit."

decals/us_mtb_25_decal/desc;"The emblem of MTBRon 25 (Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 25), United States Navy. Squadron 25 was formed on June 17th, 1943, equipped with a number of Elco 80’ motor torpedo boats, primarily numbers 344 to 355. They saw action in the Southwest Pacific until the end of the Second World War, and were decommissioned on November 9th, 1945. Many of their boats were stripped in the Philippines after Japan’s surrender; those that remained were sold and liquidated in the United States during 1946. The emblem of the 25th — a PT boat zoomorphized into a shark, was positioned sporadically on the squadron’s boats. A common placement was on the rounded sections of the superstructure behind the bridge."
decals/de_pz_rg_18_anglerfish_decal;(Tauch-)PzAbt. B Emblem

Panzer-Division (""Submersible"" Tank Battalion B, 18th Panzer Regiment, 18th Panzer Division), Wehrmacht. The 18th Panzer Regiment was formed in December 1940 in relation to Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain that never materialized. The tanks were converted into ""Tauchpanzers"" or diving tanks — they would be dropped by a barge offshore and would drive along the seafloor to the beaches. Due to the nautical nature of the division, several regiments featured fish-themed markings to link them to the operation. Placement varied slightly, but the anglerfish was most commonly positioned on the rear of the turret on the Pz.III and Pz.IV tanks, either just under the cupola bulge or to the left of it."
decals/uk_my_boy_decal;"""My Boy"" Inscription"
decals/uk_my_boy_decal/desc;"Personal inscription of 2nd Lt. Alistair Sinclair Rae, South African Air Force. Al was born on August 30th, 1929 in Durban, South Africa, and was interested in aviation from a young age. When he turned 21 he joined the SAAF and flew the P-51 and F-86 during the Korean War. He managed to avoid combat with enemy jets, with his role primarily focused on ground attack sorties. Al loved the Mustang, calling it a ""beautiful bloody aircraft"". He took a keen interest in preserving the history of the Korean War well after it concluded, aiming to help younger generations learn about the conflict. Due to his infatuation with the plane, the inscription ""My Boy"" could be found beneath the front of the engine exhaust on his P-51D, number 369."
decals/jp_hinomaru_fan_decal;"""Hinomaru Fan"" Emblem "
decals/jp_hinomaru_fan_decal/desc;"""Hinomaru Fan"" Emblem, Imperial Japanese Army. The emblem depicts a type of war fan, either a Gunsen (military fan) or Tessen (iron fan). This marking is linked to one of the independent tankette platoons operating in China during the late 1930s. While examples of these tankette emblems exist, the lack of accurate battle records makes it difficult to associate the fan with one particular platoon. It is also possible that this marking was more of an auxiliary emblem, symbolizing communication or support while attached to a larger unit, or fulfilling a specific role within the base platoon. It could be found on Type 94 Tankettes and their tracked ammunition trailers, positioned on the rear plate."

It doesn’t appear to have lasted long on the aircraft however, as later photos lack the face. It was placed under the middle of the cockpit on the right side, roughly the same size as the ejection seat symbol to its right."
