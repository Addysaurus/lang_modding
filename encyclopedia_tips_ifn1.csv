loading/tip3;"Following the surrounding of the 101st Airborne Division in Bastogne in late 1944, Gen. McAuliffe told his troops about how the Germans wanted them to surrender, and that their response would be ""To the German Commander: NUTS!""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip4;China and Romania had notably strong ties in terms of military trade during much of the Cold War. In the 1970s and 80s, China sent H5 jet bombers to Romania, while it in turn received examples of the T-72 Ural-1, TAB-77, and TABC-79 for evaluation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip5;In both Vietnamese and via ISO 3166, Vietnam is written as Viet Nam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tip7;D Company of 6 RAR (108 men), with help from various auxiliary forces, fought off roughly 2,000 VC and PAVN soldiers during the Battle of Long Tan in 1966. 18 deaths were recorded amongst Australian forces, with between 50 and 250 Vietnamese killed. Both sides claimed victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip8;"Germany originally used the term ""Tankabwehrkanone / Ta.K."" (Tank Defence Gun), as there was no other widely used name for ""tank"" at the time. When Germany switched to ""Panzer"", anti-tank guns were renamed ""Panzerabwehrkanone / Pa.K."".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip9;57 guinea pigs, 109 mice, 146 pigs, 176 goats, and 3,030 white rats were present during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests. Pig #311 reportedly survived, and was found swimming in the lagoon after the blast. It was later sent to the National Zoo in Washington, DC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip10;The Heavy Cruiser 'USS Prinz Eugen' was the only German warship to have survived not one, but two atomic detonations. Both occurred during Operation Crossroads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip11;"The Latin term bis is used in many languages to dictate a ""second"" model. France, Italy, and the USSR were the primary users of this system, including models beyond bis such as ter (third) and quater (fourth).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip12;Prior to the invasion of Poland in 1939, Germany performed a number of false flag efforts including the Gleiwitz incident. These actions were ultimately unnecessary as the Allies declared war on Germany following the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip13;In 1943 the hydroelectric dam at Zaporozh'ye (Ukranian SSR) was the largest dam in the world at the time. German forces destroyed it on 15 Oct 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip14;"The famous ""Suomi"" submachine gun was officially known as the 7,65 mm konepistooli m/26 (abbreviated as 7,65 kp/26). The nickname was passed over to the 9,00 kp/31, and was so widespread that even Finnish documents mention its use.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip15;Heeresgruppe Weichsel (Army Group Vistula) was originally commanded by Heinrich Himmler from 24 Jan 1945 to 20 Mar 1945, marking his second time in control of an army group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip16;The HK MG4 5.56mm machine gun entered service in the Bundeswehr as the MG 4, not to be confused with the South African MG4 7.62mm machine gun manufactured by Denel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip17;The MG 1 is a Rheinmetall-produced M.G. 42 manufactured for 7.62x51mm instead of 7.92x57mm. The weapon was physically identical in every other way, but future models such as the MG 1 A1 corrected the sights for the new ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip18;The MG 2 is a Rheinmetall-produced conversion of war-time M.G. 42 to fire 7.62x51mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip19;The MG 3 is a Rheinmetall-produced machine gun developed by modernizing the MG 1 A3 further. A number of variants have been developed, including the MG 3 A1 which is meant for internal tank mounts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip20;The FN FAL, SIG SG 510, HK G3, and AR-10 competed for adoption in the Bundeswehr, designated G 1 through G 4 respectively. The G 1 was originally chosen as the winner, but due to licencing issues with FN, HK's model was chosen instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip21;The M.G. 34 featured a single-shot trigger function, which simulated a rifle shot. A concept was devised where a machine gun would deploy, and pretend to be a rifle. It would fire off a few rounds, and wait for enemy movement, before unleashing fully automatic fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip22;In the 2010s, the Russian company Molot Oruzhiye developed the VPO-512 - a civilian conversion of the famous PPSh-41 limited to semi-automatic firing only.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip23;In Jun 2022, Lithuanian civilians crowdfunded almost 6 million Euros to purchase a Bayraktar with the intent of gifting it to Ukraine. Baykar instead donated the Bayraktar TB2 to UA forces and redistributed the crowdfunds between humanitarian aid and drone operational expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip24;The FN SCAR series of infantry rifles was adopted by the U.S. Marines in the 2000s/2010s. The SCAR-L and -H saw trials as EX 16 MOD 0 and EX 17 MOD 0 respectively, and after adoption MK 16 MOD 0 and MK 17 MOD 0. The FN SSR was adopted as the MK 20 MOD 0.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip25;Like with XM1 being the prototype/trial version of M1, the U.S. Navy uses EX instead of MK. For example, a prototype MK 1 MOD 0 would be EX 1 MOD 0.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip26;In Jan 2023, the XM5 as part of the Next Generation Squad Weapon - Rifle, was renamed XM7 due to a copyright concern from Colt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip27;The QTS11 is a Chinese combination firearm combining a modified QBZ03 and a single-shot 20mm grenade launcher. The weapon was developed in a similar fashion to that of the American OICW, incorporating smart fuze arming and infantry Helmet-Mounted Display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip28;The M2 Browning has had numerous efforts to replace it, but so far none have succeeded. The XM806 was a lightweight experimental model, weighing almost half that of the original M2. It was ultimately cancelled in favour of the M2A1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip29;In the face of the German invasion, many Soviet factories were evacuated to the Urals to prevent capture or destruction. №183 would move from Kharkiv to Nizhny Tagil, №174 would move from Leningrad to Omsk, and №100 would be partially evacuated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip30;The SS was considered by many to be an elite force, and while one or two units were as such, the majority were anything but. As a result, some of the units received excellent equipment whilst others received surplus captured equipment, if that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip31;"The German designation ""Nebelwerfer"" (Nb.W.) (Smoke launcher) was a cover name for a series of towed rocket launchers. The designation stuck even after the Allied forces discovered the true usage, but newly developed late-war rocket launchers used Raketenwerfer (R.W. / Rak.W.).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip32;The AM-17 is a Russian assault carbine developed in the late 2010s by Kalashnikov Concern. The weapon is essentially a modernized AKS-74U, but with modern furniture. An integrally suppressed model in 9x39mm was also manufactured, the AMB-17.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip33;"The Soviet Union developed plans for ""war-time"" production AK weapons (using V suffixes: AKMV, RPKV, etc.). These weapons would be simplified for mass production, even more so than non-wartime models. It is unknown whether any weapons were built to this standard, however.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip34;The AK-103 is essentially an AKM brought up to AK-74M standards. The weapon utilizes all the features present in the AK-74M, including the folding stock, rail interface system, and furniture. The only difference between the AK-103 and the AK-74M is the chambering and muzzle device.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip35;The AK-74M marked the first entry in the AK-100 generation (itself being AK-100). The AK-105 would be the compact model, the AK-101 and 102 would be the full-size and compact models in 5.56x45mm, and the AK-103 and 104 would be in 7.62x39mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip36;The AK-200 (formerly AK-100M) is a further modernized AK-74M (AK-100), with integrated picatinny rails. All six AK-100 models would receive the same upgrades in this series, creating the AK-200 series.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip37;Before the Soviet RPKS light machine gun was developed, the RPK-D was used as a stop-gap measure for airborne troops. The weapon would not be widely adopted, with very little information about the weapon surviving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip38;Russian RPK light machine guns utilized the RPK-200 series which featured the same improvements that the AK-100 series received. The three models developed are the RPK-200 (RPK-74M) in 5.45x39mm, RPK-201 in 5.56x45mm, and RPK-203 (RPKM) in 7.62x39mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip39;The Nagant M. 1895 revolver was licence manufactured in the Russian Empire by Izhmash and TOZ as the R-95. The weapon remained in service until the 1950s, but the rare suppressed model may still be in service to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip40;"The German nickname ""Uhu"" (Eagle-Owl) was assigned to multiple pieces of military equipment, including the Fw 189 reconnaissance aircraft, He 219 night fighter, and even the mittlerer Schützenpanzerwagen (Infrarotscheinwerfer) (Sd.Kfz. 251/20) infrared searchlight vehicle.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip41;The 15cm Fla.K. 50 is a prototype anti-aircraft gun developed in the early 1940s. It's unique in that it features an autoloading mechanism, capable of firing 10-rounds per minute. The cannon utilized AP and HE shells, and was fitted on either a cruciform or rail mount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip42;The famous 8,8cm Fla.K. 36 was such a successful design, that it was scaled for different calibers. The 12,8cm Fla.K. 40 was a common example, with the 15cm Fla.K. 55 being an experimental model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip43;The 12,8cm Pa.K. 40 was a failed German anti-tank gun developed by Rheinmetall from the 12,8cm Fla.K. 40 (an upscaled 8,8cm Fla.K. 36). The 12,8cm Pa.K. 44 from Krupp was chosen to enter service instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip44;"On 6 Aug 1945, the American ""Little Boy"" atomic bomb was detonated in Hiroshima. On 9 Aug 1945, a second atomic bomb ""Fat Man"" was detonated in Nagasaki. Japanese forces surrendered on 15 Aug 1945.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip45;The HK416 was originally meant to be called HK M4, but due to legal concerns from Colt, the name was changed to HK416.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip46;The last Japanese soldier to formally surrender after the country's defeat in World War Two was Hiroo Onoda. Lieutenant Onoda finally handed over his sword on 9 Mar 1974.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip47;"The British 1st Special Service Brigade was abbreviated as the 1st SS, and in Dec 1944 it was renamed to the 1st Commando Brigade in an attempt to distance itself from the German 1. SS-Div. ""LSSAH"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip48;"In Russia the Soviet Theatre of the Second World War is referred to as the ""Great Patriotic War"". This term is based off the Russian name for Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, known in Russia as the Patriotic War.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip49;An experimental predecessor of the St.G. 44, the M.Kb. 42 (H) saw extensive combat trials in Stalingrad in 1942/43, and lead the way to the M.P. 43/I, which would become the M.P. 43, then M.P. 44, then finally St.G. 44.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip50;The M.P. 40/I was an experimental weapon that featured a quick-reloading system allowing the mounting of two magazines with a quick-switch feature. The weapon saw combat trials in Stalingrad in 1942/43.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip51;After capturing a large number of PPSh-41, the German Waffenamt began conversion of a number to utilizing 9x19mm Parabellum ammunition instead of 7.62x25mm TT. These weapons would be designated M.P. 41 (r), and use magazines from the M.P. 38 / M.P. 40.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip52;After capturing a large number of PPSh-41, the German Waffenamt approved of repurposing the weapon for domestic use. These would be designated M.P. 717 (r), and be given 7.63x25mm Mauser ammunition as it was deemed compatible with 7.62x25mm TT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip53;"The name 'Gepard', is attributed to two German self-propelled anti-aircraft guns; the FlakPz Gepard 1, and the Flak.Pz. 38 (t). There is also a Soviet experimental multi-calibre PDW using the same name.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip54;The Flare Projector 45 was a mass-produced bolt-action pistol developed to be air dropped en masse to Allied resistance fighters during WWII. British Bomber Command refused to divert bombers for deployment, but a number were dropped in Greece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip55;Prior to the Tripartite Pact, Italy, like Germany, was aligned with China during the Japanese invasion. Italian support ended however, when China enacted sanctions toward Italy for their invasion of Abyssinia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip56;When China refused to sign the Anti-Comintern pact, Japan tried to spin their invasion as an 'Anti-Communist' war, bribing Germany to accept that conclusion. Germany refused, concerned that China might join forces with the Soviet Union, defeating the purpose of the pact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip57;Following the assassination of Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dolfuß by Nazi agents in 1934, Italy moved four divisions to the Italian-Austrian border in an attempt to prevent Germany taking Austria. These actions would ultimately delay Germany until 1938 when Austria was annexed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip58;Germany re-militarized the Rhineland on 7 Mar 1936, hoping that the League of Nations would be preoccupied with other matters, such as the Italian war in Abyssinia. No retaliation was undertaken by the League.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip59;In order to fight in the Korean War without engaging in an official war with the United States, China formed the People's Volunteer Army, which consisted entirely of troops and equipment transferred from the People's Liberation Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip60;"Order 227 was the famous ""Not a step back"" order issued by Stalin in 1942. The order was aimed at officers in an attempt to prevent unnecessary withdrawals of land (Stopping the ""There is ground to spare"" saying.), but modern media portrays this as ""any retreat should be punished"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip61;"In the 1980s, IMI developed the ""Eagle"" - a magazine-fed pistol chambered in .357 Magnum. The weapon didn't take off, but formed the basis for the famous Desert Eagle.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip62;The MP 2 is the German variant of the famous IMI UZI. The Bundeswehr adopted the weapon in 1959, and remained in service until being phased out in the early 2000s. The MP 2 had a wooden stock, with the MP 2 A1 having a folding stock. Both models used 32-rnd magazines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip63;Over 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians were employed by US organisations after Germany's capitulation. Originally meant to help against Japanese forces in Operation Overcast, Operation Paperclip saw many working for NASA and other organisations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip64;Wake Island was manned by only 500 men, six 5in guns, 12 AA guns, and 12 F4F Wildcats when Japan attacked in 1941. They managed to hold out for two weeks, sinking two destroyers, a submarine, downing 10 aircraft, and causing over 500 casualties for only 100 of their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip65;On 9 Dec 1945, General George S. Patton would be severely wounded when his limousine driver sped past a railroad crossing and crashed into an Army truck. The crash broke his neck, paralyzing him, and he would succumb to his wounds 12 days later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip66;The Hanyu Pinyin system of Chinese transliteration was originally created by the PRC to raise literacy rates, but was soon adopted as the official romanization of Chinese, replacing the old Wade-Giles system. Taiwan only recently began adopting Pinyin, although it is not yet official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip67;The German East Asia Squadron had attempted to raid the presumed undefended Falkland Islands for coal stocks during their run to Germany in 1914. However, they had met the Royal Navy's 5th Cruiser Squadron and a pair of Battlecruisers in open battle and were destroyed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip68;Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine by a Russian-operated 9K37 Buk surface-to-air missile system of the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade in Jul 2014, near the beginning of the War in Donbass. All 298 people aboard the Boeing 777 died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip69;In Jan 2020, Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by a 9K330 Tor-M1 of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps shortly after take-off from Tehran. All 176 on board the Boeing 737 died, and Iran indicted various individuals responsible for the shootdown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip70;"The term ""Nazi"" was originally a derogatory word for peasant and later became a pejorative for National-Socialists, similar to ""Sozi"" (Sozialist, Sozialdemokrat) and ""Kozi"" (Kommunist). It would later be adopted as the colloquial name for the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip71;Black Buck 1 to Black Buck 7 were codes given to extreme-range bombing raids carried out by the Royal Air Force during the 1982 Falklands War. These raids had minimal strategic impact and have often been cited as a way for the Royal Air Force to avoid further budget cuts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip72;The 5.56mm T65 Rifle is a Taiwanese assault rifle developed from the earlier Type 64 prototype. The weapon was originally meant to be an AR-15 clone, but due to unknown reasons (possibly outdated industry), the simpler internals from the AR-18 were utilized instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip73;On 6 Jun 1944, 101 AB, 2-506 PIR, Easy Co, performed the Brécourt Manor Assault, where 1LT Winters led Easy Co to attack a number of howitzers defended by fixed defences. The assault became a textbook example, and is still used in training materiel to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip74;2LT Speirs of 101 AB, 2-506 PIR, Dog Co, was rumoured to have killed 6 German prisoners shortly after securing St. Marie-du-Mont in Jun 1944. Allegations were largely ignored due to officer shortages. The rumours were later confirmed by Speirs himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip75;In Jan 1945 during the Battle of Foy, 1LT Speirs of 101 AB, 2-506 PIR, Easy Co (who had just replaced 1LT Dike) ran through the German-controlled town to contact Item Co at the other side. After which, he ran back through the town and rejoined Easy Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip76;Panzerbrigade 150 was formed for Unternehmen Greif, utilizing American-speaking soldiers and equipment, it was tasked with infiltrating U.S. lines. The unit was formed with 1,000 Wehrmacht men, 500 Waffen SS men, 800 Luftwaffe men, and 200 Kriegsmarine men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip77;As part of Unternehmen Greif during the Ardennes offensive, Panzerbrigade 150 was to be equipped with captured Allied uniforms and equipment to cause havoc behind enemy lines. This would be scaled back to simply dressing Panthers and Stu.G. IIIs as American vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip78;The Type 88 is a towed version of the Chinese 105mm Type 81 Tank Gun, placing the gun on a modified Type 86 Anti-Tank Gun carriage. Based on available evidence, it is only used for testing and was used as recently as 2018 to test gun-launched ATGMs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip79;On 26 Feb 1991, two Warrior IFVs of the 3rd Bat., Royal Regiment of Fusiliers were destroyed by friendly fire from two USAF A-10s, killing 9 and wounding 11. The exact cause was never established, but it likely came down to incorrect information sent to the pilots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip80;The concept of an Infantry Gun is to provide similar ordnance to that of a Howitzer, but at a shorter range and via direct (or partially indirect) line of sight. Many such weapons would later receive HEAT cartridges to deal with armoured targets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip81;On two separate occasions in Jan 1991, soldiers of the USMC 1st Force Reconnaissance Company were mistakenly strafed by USAF A-10s. Fortunately, neither incident resulted in any casualties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip82;Kill boxes are defined battlefield sectors in which attacks on surface targets are, in simplest terms, automatically authorized and do not require coordination with higher command or other branches. They were first employed in the Gulf War and continue to be used by the US military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip83;"The M16 ""bouncing betty"" anti-personnel mine was developed from the German S.Mi. 35. These mines were capable of launching into the air before detonating, increasing the area of effect over conventional anti-personnel mines.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip84;During WWI and WWII, Germany experimented with a number of grenade styles. Stick grenades were most famous, but there was also egg- and disk-shaped designs. A more unconventional form was the Kugelhandgranate - a stick that detached a ball shaped grenade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tip89;The first permanent military force of South Africa was the Union Defence Force (UDF). This existed from 1912 to 1 Dec 1957, when the Defence Act of 1957 passed, changing its name to the South African Defence Force (SADF).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip90;The South African Defence Force (SADF) changed its name to the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) on 27 Apr 1994, which amalgamated both the SADF and former rebel forces such as the uMkhonto we Sizwe of the ANC, and the APLA of the Pan-African Congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip91;Oskar Schindler would use his enamel factory to save 1,200 Jews (originally as slave labour) from the Holocaust, spending all his wealth on bribes, the factory, and his workers. His efforts prevented their deaths in concentration camps by moving them to Brněnec in 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip92;On 14 Oct 1968, the Swiss military would accidentally hit Malbun—Liechtenstein's ski-resort village. The only recorded damages were a number of chairs belonging to a restaurant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tip99;Chiang Wei-kuo, adoptive son of Chiang Kai-shek, studied at the Kriegsschule and later became a Wehrmacht officer, even participating in the Anschluß in 1938. He was then promoted to Lieutenant of a Panzer unit, but was recalled to China prior to the invasion of Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip100;Unit 731 was a research unit within the Imperial Japanese Army, known for human experimentation. Its victims were subject to chemical, biological, conventional explosive, and bladed weapons, as well as exploratory surgeries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip101;Mao Anying, eldest son of Mao Zedong, was killed by a raid of B-26 Invaders of the 3rd B.G. in Korea. According to some, he was cooking food during daytime, which was strictly forbidden, resulting in his encampment being spotted by U.S. forces, although this is highly disputed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tip105;After the M16 Rifle was introduced, the M14 was seen as a better choice by many servicemen. The reliability and weaker cartridge were seen as the main concerns, but even after the M16A1 fixed a number of issues the cartridge was still seen as underpowered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip106;ARVN forces during the Viet Nam War were often seen using surplus U.S. equipment, including equipment last issued during WWII and Korea. M1 Helmets, M1 Rifles, M1 Carbines, and other pieces of uniform and equipment were used to great effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip107;"After Germany surrendered during WWII, U.S. soldiers were soon to be redeployed to Japan. A ""points"" system was employed in order to honourable discharge personnel but didn't take into account time, as many Normandy veterans didn't have enough points to return home.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tip108;The Australian Defence Force replaced its Lithgow made L1A1 rifle with a domestic Steyr AUG copy known as the F88. The weapon has seen a number of variants, including the overhauled F90.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/aircraft/tip74;The RLM designated all aircraft as 8-###, where ### is replaced with the digits commonly seen in designations such as Bf 109 (8-109). For clarity, the RLM allowed for manufacturer codes to replace the number prefix, but officially the prefix remained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip75;The first aircraft assigned to an RLM number is the Fi 2 'Tiger' — an aerobatics plane that flew in the World Aerobatics Competition, winning the 1934 competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip76;In Nov 1937, the He 119 V4 made a record flight carrying a 1,000kg payload 1,000km, at 505km/h.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip77;The Harbin H5 was not an exact copy of the Ilyushin Il-28. Aside from the use of domestic components, there were minor structural changes, such as to the canopy and landing lights, as well as the rear turret being adapted from the Tu-16 (H6).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip78;In 1947, early production MiG-9 interceptors were test-flown against a variety of propeller and jet fighters, including the La-9, P-63, Spitfire, Yak-15, La-156, as well as the Tu-2. In maneuverability tests, the MiG-9 lost to all aircraft except the Tu-2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip79;A torpedo-bomber version of the Q5, the Q5Yi, was experimentally built and tested during the 1970s. Recognizable through its flattened nose, it would be plagued with technical issues until cancelled in 1979. Its role would eventually be filled by the JH7.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip80;During WWII, China was capable of some aircraft manufacturing. Modifications of existing aircraft such as the Chung 28 Chia (I-16) and Chung 28 I (I-15bis), as well as partially indigenous designs such as the XP-0, AP-1, and XB-3 were all manufactured in small numbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip81;Chinese forces had their own slightly modified names for some imported Soviet aircraft. Examples include I-15 (I-15bis), I-15-3 (I-153), I-16-3 (late I-16 models), SB-2 (SB 2M-100A), and SB-3 (SB 2M-103U).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip82;The initial production batch of Yak-9P aircraft in 1946 were still made from a mixed construction of wood and metal and had a weaker armament of 1x 20mm ShVAK-20 and 2x 12.7mm UB. The all-metal cannon-armed version did not appear until 1947.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip83;During testing of the prototypes of the MiG-9, it was discovered that firing the cannons, especially at high altitude, would flame out the engines. This problem was never solved, and pilots were given a myriad of instructions on when and which caliber of cannon could be fired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip84;The first prototype of what later became the Yak-15, sometimes called the Yak-YuMO or Yak-Jumo, was not sufficiently resistant to heat. During ground tests in 1945, the exhaust from the engine melted parts of the underside of the rear fuselage as well as the tail wheel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/newbie/tip85;Starting in 1947, USA designated various Soviet aircraft Type ## for identification purposes. For example, MiG-9 was Type 1, the MiG-15bis was Type 19, and the Tu-95 was Type 40. This system was replaced in 1955.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip86;The Royal Thai Air Force operated the Ki 30 light bomber under the designation B.J.2 in the 1940s. It saw combat against French forces during the French-Thai War in 1940/1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/newbie/tip87;The Imperial Japanese military operated two air forces, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS), and the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS). Each used their own models of aircraft, engines, and armaments with unique designation systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip88;The AC-47 was originally designated FC-47 (Fighter Cargo 47), but was changed to AC-47 (Attack Cargo 47) after complaints from USAF pilots were received that pointed out that the intended role is not to combat aircraft, but to attack ground targets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip89;Project Tailchaser saw the development of an experimental fixed-wing gunship aircraft in 1964, starting with a converted Convair C-131B to fit a single GAU-2/A in the left side of the aircraft at a low angle. Tests were promising, and later, conversions of C-47s and C-123s were undertaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip90;"The ACH-47 was a combat conversion of the CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter. It featured a number of gunpods and rockets for close air support. It was sparingly known as ""Guns a Go-Go"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip91;"The AC-47 was a combat conversion of the C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft. It featured a number of machine guns installed in the rear and sides, allowing for close air support of ground troops. It was nicknamed ""Spooky"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip92;The Hawk 81 model used by the American Volunteer Group in China were a special batch combining parts of the P-40B (H-81A-2) and P-40C (H-81A-3) models. In records they are known as H-81A-3, although they lack equipment such as bomb racks or armoured glass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip93;"The Ba 349 ""Natter"" was a rocket-powered interceptor armed with 24 7,3cm Hs 297 rockets in the nose. The aircraft was capable of vertical take-off, but the only known flight resulted in the death of the pilot.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip94;In addition to the I-15, I-153, and I-16 fighters, SB bombers, and UTI-4 trainers, the Soviet Union provided a small number of TB-3 heavy bombers to China as part of Operation Zet in 1937.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip95;Despite the Yak-15 being ready months before the MiG-9, on 24 Apr 1946, Mikoyan was given special permission to fly his aircraft first, beating Yakovlev to creating the USSR's first jet fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip96;During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, the ROCAF was given AIM-9B Sidewinders for their F-86s to counter the new Chinese MiG-17. One missile failed to detonate and become lodged into a MiG-17, allowing it to be recovered and copied by the Soviets as the R-3S.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip97;In the 1970s, the PLAN Air Force looked to develop an improved version of their Bye-6 aircraft. The modified version was named Qīng-6, it was re-engined with WJ6 turboprops, equipped with more antisubmarine equipment, and modified armament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip98;A problem noted in early on in tests of the MiG-9 was its inability to slow down, leading to pilots needing to perform landings at relatively high speeds. Despite some prototypes having them, small airbrakes near the wing roots would not be fitted until the 450th production airframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip99;The IJAAS adapted ground-based cannons into aircraft armaments in many instances. Examples in-game include the 3,7cm Type 94 Anti-Tank gun on the Ki-45 Kai Otsu and the 7,5cm Type 88 Anti-Aircraft Gun on the Ki-109.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip100;The Tu-95LAL was created to test the application of nuclear reactors and radiation protection for airplanes. It was flown 34 times between May and Aug 1961, with the tests proving successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip101;"The nickname ""Sambad"" for the Super Mystere B2 comes from the abbreviation ""SMB2,"" which in Hebrew is pronounced as ""SMBD"" or ""Sambad.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip102;Despite the fact that the F-20 Tigershark was partly initiated to meet Taiwan's requests for a new AIM-7 capable fighter, warming relations between the US and People's Republic of China blocked their sale long before the programme had even begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip103;The Republic of China successfully developed an advanced jet fighter, the F-CK-1, after being unable to acquire modern jets like the F-16. Designed with the aid of General Dynamics, its upgraded models are comparable to later F-16 models in performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip104;In the 1970s, Taiwan created their own gunship variant of the C-119. The local AC-119 could be outfitted with AN/M3 .50 Caliber machine guns,  20mm M39A1 cannons, or even two 20mm M61 Vulcan cannons in various configurations. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip105;The Army-subordinate Australian Flying Corps was succeeded by the independent Australian Air Force on 31 Mar 1921. King George V gave assent for the service to use the 'royal' prefix, effectively changing the name to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 13 Aug 1921.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip106;"The A-10 attack aircraft is officially known as the ""Thunderbolt II"", but it is usually known by the more common unofficial nickname ""Warthog"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip107;China was fond of installing turboprops onto older Soviet propeller-driven aircraft. The most well-known conversion was to the Bye-6, but other aircraft such as the Tu-4 and even the Il-10 were converted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip108;The MiG-21PD and MiG-23PD were created in order to reduce the distance required for take-off. They had two vertically installed RD36-35 engines but due to problems with the exhaust fumes entering the intakes, they were not developed further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip109;S. A. Lavochkin developed numerous experimental rocket engine testbeds by installing RD-1 and RD-1KhZ rocket engines in the tail section. The tests were successful with noticeable speed increases, however the nitric acid used on the fuel damaged the airframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip110;While most PLA Air Force ordnance use a code name (e.g. PL standing for Pi Li, or Thunderbolt), guns and bombs are only identified by their caliber followed by a model number, such as Model 250-3 for the third version of a 250kg bomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip111;In the 1960s, the PRC would offer rewards of gold for defecting ROCAF pilots, with certain values for specific aircraft types. Xu Tingze would collect 2,500 taels in 1963 for his F-86F, while in 1969 instructor Huang Tianming and student Zhu Jingrong would receive 1,200 for a T-33A.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip112;"Although manufactured by Focke-Wulf, several of their late-war aircraft such as the Ta 152 and Ta 184 use the index ""Ta"" instead of ""Fw"" as their design was headed by Kurt Tank.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip113;For 44 years, the Antonov An-225 held the record as the heaviest aircraft ever built. The Mriya routinely attracted a global following due to its size and its uniqueness. The only completed An-225 was destroyed by Russian forces in the Battle of Antonov Airport in Feb 2022.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip114;Initially, Chinese aircraft used a Type-number system, similar to their other equipment of the time. However, in the 1960s, this was changed to the role-classification (e.g. J, H, Q) in use today. Examples of the older system include the Type 56 (J5), Type 59 (J6), and Type 62 (J7).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip115;Major Richard Bong was an American fighter ace during WWII. He flew P-38s in the Pacific theatre, and is credited with shooting down 40 Japanese aircraft. Richard died in 1945 testing the P-80. Richard Bong is one of the most decorated flying aces in American history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip116;Major Joe Foss was an American fighter ace during WWII. He flew an F4F Wildcat in the Pacific theatre, and scored 26 victories. Most of those were against A6Ms, but two G4Ms, two F1Ms, and one E13A were among them. He is also a Medal of Honor recipient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip117;Major Thomas McGuire was an American fighter ace during WWII. He flew P-38s in the Pacific theatre, and is credited with shooting down 38 enemy aircraft. He was shot down by a Ki 43 in Jan 1945. Thomas McGuire is one of the most decorated flying aces in American history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip118;Captain David McCampbell was an American fighter ace during WWII. He flew an F6F Hellcat in the Pacific theatre, and is credited with shooting down 38 aircraft. David McCampbell is one of the most decorated flying aces in American history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip119;Throughout the production of the Yak-1 and Yak-7, the engine was gradually improved, starting with the M-105, then the M-105P, and finally the M-105PA. These changes were not correlated with other airframe changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip120;"The ""Bockscar"" was a B-29-36-MO (s/n: 44-27297) bomber that was responsible for dropping the ""Fat Man"" atomic bomb on Nagasaki on 9 Aug 1945.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip121;"The ""Enola Gay"" was a B-29-45-MO (s/n: 44-86292) bomber that was responsible for dropping the ""Little Boy"" atomic bomb on Hiroshima on 6 Aug 1945.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip122;German Flaktürme were huge fortifications fitting a number of light and heavy anti-aircraft guns in raised positions. Eight towers were constructed, each in important strategic positions. These towers were formidable, many surviving in some form to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip123;In 2022, FedEx petitioned the FAA to install a directed infrared countermeasure system to protect their aircraft from heat-seeking missiles, although the request was rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip124;The F/A-18 Hornet's name does not conform to the 1962 Tri-service designation system, where it would be designated AF-18. This was due to the Navy's Lightweight Fighter competition originally requiring two separate aircraft (F-18 and A-18) for each role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip125;Despite being perfectly suitable, Berlin Tempelhof Airport was not used as a military airfield during WWII. The greatest extent of military activity was the assembly of aircraft parts and occasional emergency landings, and largely maintained civilian flights for the duration of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip126;In 1983, after mistakenly straying into Soviet airspace while en-route to Seoul, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Su-15 interceptor, leading to the loss of all 269 passengers aboard the Boeing 747. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip127;Both the Tu-104 and Tu-114 airliners were created by widening the fuselages of bomber designs. The Tu-104, developed from the Tu-16, became notorious for its high accident rate, while the Tu-114, derived from the Tu-95, was noted for its discomfort and loud turboprops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip128;While test flying the then-unknown P-59 Airacomet, Chief Test Pilot for Bell Aircraft Jack Woolams wore a gorilla mask with a bowler hat and cigar to mess with other pilots. He would fly into formations of propeller aircraft, wave at them, and then fly away, surprising the pilots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip129;Although Martin-Baker had carried out experiments in ejection seats as early as 1934, the death of Capt Valentine Baker in 1943 while test-flying the MB.3 led the company to shift its focus towards pilot safety. The company now exclusively manufactures safety-oriented aircraft seats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip130;The F-16AJ was a proposal by General Dynamics to create an F-16 specifically for Japan. Although similar to the American Block 15 standard, it primarily added the ability to carry the AIM-7F Sparrow. It was ultimately rejected with Japan instead developing the F-2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip131;"Upon introduction, the P-51 was given the name ""Apache"" by the USAAF, including aircraft for the RAF that were seized in 1941. The name would remain until Jul 1942 when it was replaced by the RAF's designation ""Mustang.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip132;"In the mid-1950s, USSR developed a thermonuclear bomb which received the designation AN602 ""Ivan"", but it was more commonly known in the West as the Tsar Bomba.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip133;During a test of the Me 163, fighter ace Josef Pöhs would accidentally jettison the take-off dolly too early, damaging a fuel line, and causing the aircraft to crash. Pöhs was killed, his right arm dissolved from the corrosive fuel, with his head and other arm liquified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip134;"Captain Eric Brown made an unapproved flight of the Me 163 B after the war, despite protest from ground crews. He successfully landed and celebrated with airfield personnel. In his log of the flight, he noted ""Handling to 32,000! Fantastic!"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip135;The SADF instituted a policy of mandatory landmine incident reporting during the 1980s. The data yielded was important to further refine South African MRAP technologies, though troops in the field saw this as unnecessary paperwork. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip136;The 'Super Hind' modernisation package was developed by the South African ATE corporation at the request of the Algerian Air Force to modernise its ageing fleet of Mi-24 helicopters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip137;In Petrovka in 1943, Luftwaffe pilot Günther Rall made a force landing with his Bf 109 G behind Soviet lines. A nearby mechanized assault by German forces spotted his landing and redirected their forces to recover the pilot, before falling back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/newbie/tip138;In the years leading up to WWII, the French Armée de l'Air added a letter-number code to most aircraft indicating their role and crew complement. A single-seat fighter (chasseur) would be C1 (e.g. MS.410.C1), while a three-seat bomber would be B3 (e.g. DB-7 B3);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip139;Following WWII, the P-51 (later F-51) remained in service as an emergency fighter until the 1960s. One of the last official flights by the US military was F-51D-25-NA in 1968, being used as a chase aircraft for the experimental YAH-56 Cheyenne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip140;"Late-production PBY-5As (starting with BuNo 46580) received a new ""eyeball"" bow turret with two machine guns, replacing the older, single-gun design. This would be adopted on subsequent models, such as the PBY-6A.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip141;Me 262 V1 — the first Me 262 prototype — featured a Jumo 004 propeller engine. Initial tests were flown with just this engine, testing the airframe, but later tests would implement the BMW 003 jet engines with the propeller remaining as backup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip142;Clive Caldwell was an Australian fighter ace during WWII, scoring roughly 30 air victories between his service in the Pacific and North Africa. He flew a Spitfire Mk. VIII marked CRC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip143;The joint-venture Eurocopter EC-655 was known as Tigre in France, and Tiger in Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip144;Eurocopter was a conglomeration of the helicopter divisions of Aérospatiale and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm. It would later be re-branded as Airbus Helicopters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip145;The Me 155 was a planned high-altitude fighter developed by Messerschmitt. The project was transferred to Blohm und Voss as Messerschmitt was failing to meet deadlines, seemingly overly invested in its development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip146;The Sikorsky R-4 was the world's first mass-produced helicopter, entering service in 1943. The R-4 was the USAAS designation for Rotorcraft, with the British designating it the Hoverfly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip147;The Fa 223 was an experimental German helicopter developed in 1940. 20 prototypes were manufactured, with plans for numerous production models. The factory was bombed before serial production could begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip148;In 1959, during the opening ceremony for a new civilian terminal at CFB Uplands in Ottawa, Canada, a USAF F-104 made a low pass over the airport at supersonic speeds, causing extensive damage to the windows, ceiling, and even structural beams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip149;The F-102 Delta Dagger was the first plane to enter service featuring an onboard weapons bay, in which the FCS would lock a target and an internal rack carrying missiles would lower and unlock the missiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip150;The 1951 GAR-1 Falcon was the first IR missile to have its seeker head fully slaved to the FCS, allowing the missile to lock and launch without having the missile physically see the target. A capability only comparable to the 1974 R-23T and its IRST locking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip151;In Jan/Feb 1942, General MacArthur ordered construction of airfields in Mindanao (Philippines) to improve its defence. By 1 Mar, sixteen all-weather airfields capable of accommodating any aircraft in service were completed in Mindanao, Negros, Cebu, Pansy, and Bohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip152;The Hindenburg airship (D-LZ 129) was designed with Helium-4 in mind, but due to American bans on Helium exports, Hydrogen-1 had to be used instead. It is theorized that the Hydrogen fuel was not the cause of its destruction, but no solid evidence has proven any cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip153;Beginning development in 1975, the South African Air Force were the first military to utilise Helmet Mounted Sights on their combat aircraft. This system paired with the V3 series of AAM's saw successes over Angola.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip154;Initial Soviet Helmet Mounted Sights were copies of South African HMSs, which were stolen through intelligence means by their spy, former South African Navy Commodore Dieter Gerhardt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip155;On 5 Apr 1968, Flt Lt Alan Pollock flew a Hunter F.G.A. Mk. 9 under Tower Bridge and near other landmarks in London. His reasoning for this unauthorized flight was that the Ministry of Defence failed to recognize the 50th anniversary of the founding of the RAF.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip156;In the early 1960s, Project High Wire modified F-100D and F aircraft by standardizing cockpit design and wiring, increasing ordnance options, and adding a tailhook for bad landings. They were distinguished by adding one to the block number, e.g. F-100D-25 became F-100D-26.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip157;On 10 Dec 1963, during an attempt to break the 113,980 ft altitude record, Chuck Yeager was forced to eject from his NF-104 (56-0762) when he lost control and entered at flatspin at 104,000 ft. The ejection seat partially malfunctioned, causing burns on his hands and face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip158;The RAAF originally intended to give the F-111C an official name in service, including the Aboriginal words Bindana (Thunder) and Bilara (Spear). However, neither of these were adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip159;The UH-1 Iroquois was initially known as the HU-1 until the designation was changed in 1962. Since Japan began license production before the name change, the name as HU-1 was kept for both the HU-1B and HU-1H until 1992, when they were eventually switched to UH-1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip160;"Under the ""Peace Tiger"" program, Northrop-Grumman and AIDC began plans for license production of the F-5E Tiger II in 1973. A total of 242 F-5E and 66 F-5F would enter service through 1986, making Taiwan the largest F-5 operator in the world.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip161;During Taiwanese production of the F-5E Tiger II, it was decided that retooling to produce the two-seat F-5F variant would be uneconomical. Instead, 66 Taiwanese-produced F-5E fuselages were exchanged for 66 American-built F-5F fuselages, which were assembled in Taiwan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip162;In 1997, the Tiger 2000 program was initiated by Taiwan to modernize the F-5E. It featured a new GD-53 radar, MIL-STD-1553B datalink, GPS/INS, and TC-2 (Sky Sword II) BVR air-to-air missiles. It made its first flight in 2002, but was rejected due to the acquisition of F-16s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip163;Initial production MiG-19's had poorly placed airbrakes which produced significant turbulence over the tailplane. This was especially problematic at speeds above Mach 0.9, where the imbalanced would cause the aircraft to become directionally unstable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip164;Mikoyan explored the idea of using the MiG-19 as a tactical nuclear weapon delivery platform designated izd. SM-9/9. This project was cancelled after it was found that the platform did not provide any advantages over in-service types in this role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip165;The Luftwaffe's first combat operations since 1945 was during Operation Deliberate Force in 1995 over Bosnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip166;Early MiG-19S aircraft saw significant fuel pressure fluctuations beyond the pump while using afterburner. These would be rectified by the Model 495A pump, utilising a bypass feature to maintain consistent pressure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip167;MiG-19S aircraft from 1959 onwards featured an AP-28 Autopilot system which, among other features, gave the pilot the ability to press a button for the autopilot to return the aircraft to straight and level flight at any altitude in-case the pilot was disorientated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip168;The Fliegerfaust was a prototype man-portable air-defence weapon developed by Germany near the end of WWII. It was designed with multiple tubes to fire a single, scattered salvo of unguided rockets against low-flying aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip169;"Ya.G. Taubin, developer of the PTB-23, would be arrested for ""Anti-Soviet conspiracy"", claiming that he was actively developing equipment intended to fail. On 28 Oct 1941, Taubin and 19 others were executed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/aircraft/tip172;In lieu of its delayed F-111 order, the RAAF leased 24 F-4E Phantom aircraft to fill the capability gap left by the retirement of the Canberra bombers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip173;Structural strength concerns around the F-111C prompted concern in the RAAF who opted to explore different options under Decision 296 in 1970. Including considerations for the adoption of the F-4E instead, or the wait for the F-111F expected in 1972.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip174;The BAC TSR-2 tactical bomber was one of the leading contenders in the RAAF's plan to replace the Canberra. The TSR-2 was still in development as of the 1960s and as an interim solution, the British Government offered to base a squadron of V bombers in Australia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip175;The A-26 Invader was designed with several nose options, including several which housed 37mm and 75mm cannons. However, none of those heavy gun options saw service, with machine gun-only noses being the only models used operationally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip176;Early models of the A-26B Invader came with six .50 cal. machine guns in the nose along with underwing gondolas containing additional machine guns. Later in production, eight guns were fitted into the nose and six into the wings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip177;Project Winchester was the name for the SANDF's requirement for lead-in fighter trainers, leading to the acquisition of 24 BAE Hawk Mk. 120 jets in 2008.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip178;The SANDF acquired 26 JAS 39 Gripen fighters under Project Ukhozi, with the first unit received in May 2008.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip179;"During the initial months of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a mythical ""Ghost of Kyyiv"" fighter ace would circulate social media. Despite many claims of their kills, and many of them being shot down, there is no evidence proving their existence beyond a propaganda tool.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip180;In the 1980s, the U.S. leased 25 modified Kfir Gderots from Israel, adopted as the F-21A Lion. These aircraft were unarmed and used purely as mock opponents in dissimilar air combat training (DACT).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip181;Although sources differ on the exact date and reasoning, the Yak-41M's name was officially changed to Yak-141 sometime between 1987 and 1991. Should the final version of the aircraft, internally known as izd. 48M, have entered production, it would have been called Yak-141.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/aircraft/tip184;The 30kg Type 99 No. 3 Mod. 3 was an incendiary cluster bomb developed by Japan, intended in the anti-aircraft role. It would detonate above enemy bombers, igniting 168 phosphorus-filled pellets in an attempt to set them on fire. The weapon was ineffective in actual combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip185;Due to the large number of lend-lease Hurricanes, Soviet forces converted several into two-seat trainer aircraft with reduced armament and no armor. At least one example was also converted into an artillery observer and fitted with a single defensive machine gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip186;On 8 Jul 1943, Schlachtgeschwader 1 claimed over 50 tank kills with Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft against the 2nd Guards Tank Corps at Kursk. This is often claimed to be the first defeat of an armor unit purely with air power—however, its truthfulness and kill counts are disputed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip187;When Japan purchased 12 He 112 B-0 fighters from Germany, they were given the designation A7He1, despite not being carrier fighters, as suggested by the letter A. Although much faster than the A5M, the inferior maneuverability and climb rate relegated them to training roles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip188;The YB-40 was a bomber-defense gunship, essentially a B-17F fitted with additional turrets and increasing the number of guns in existing turrets. Twenty combat versions were built and flew operationally in 1943, after which the program was terminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/aircraft/tip197;"While investigating a captured A6M, Vought engineers noticed many similarities with their own V-143, particularly the cowling and landing gear. This led to a rumor that the ""Zero"" copied the V-143, the sole example of which had been sold to Japan in 1937, but it is unsubstantiated.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip198;During the Korean War, the Soviet Union secretly deployed their own pilots to fly MiG-15s with North Korean or Chinese markings. Further precautions, such as wearing Chinese uniforms and limiting use of Russian, were taken to prevent the Soviet intervention from being discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip199;On 18 Sep 1942, the last Hurricane of convoy PQ 18 was launched by catapult from the SS Empire Morn, intercepting German He 111s. Instead of ditching the aircraft, Flying Officer Burr chose to fly to Russia, landing at Keg Ostrov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip200;The first lend-lease Hurricane deliveries to the USSR were conducted in an unusual manner, with 24 aircraft of 151st Wing RAF taking off from HMS Argus and landing in Murmansk in Aug 1941. British specialists trained Soviet pilots and conducted joint air patrols until the end of the year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip201;Despite its reputation, on a per-launch basis the AIM-4 fired from the F-4D platform achieved a confirmed kill rate of 12.19%. Comparatively, the AIM-7 attained a 9.2% confirmed kill rate, while the AIM-9 attained a 17.6% confirmed kill rate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/aircraft/tip203;"The Air-To-Air Stinger (ATAS) is a helicopter-mounted version of the man-portable FIM-92 Stinger. Interestingly, it is not designated ""AIM-92"", even though the new launch environment would typically come with such a designation change.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip204;The initial MiG-31 had no deadstick landing guide in its flight manual as it was thought to be impossible. In Sep 1979, Valyerij Myenitskij performed a deadstick landing during a test flight that resulted in the MiG-31's first and only unpaved runway landing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip205;Although it was a stealth aircraft, the United States made no attempt to destroy the F-117 shot down over Serbia in 1999, which allowed Russian and possibly Chinese groups to study it. The Pentagon claimed the technology was dated, and the Nighthawk was retired soon after in 2008.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip206;"In 1999, an American F-117 Nighthawk was downed by a Serbian S-125 SAM system, the first shootdown of a stealth aircraft.

loading/aircraft/tip207;On 7 Oct 1959, an RB-57D piloted by Lt. Wang Ying Chin was shot down by a PRC S-75 missile as the aircraft inadvertently passed through PRC airspace during descent. This was the first confirmed case of a SAM intercepting an aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip208;The AIM-4 Falcon was the first air-to-air guided missile of the U.S., produced in both IR- and radar-guided variants. It had a reputation for unreliability and was largely overtaken by the AIM-7 and AIM-9, although late variants were used by the F-102 and F-106 through the 1980s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip209;The AIM-7 Sparrow is an American SARH guided missile developed in the late 1950s. Originally designed to hunt large, slow targets like bombers, later variants became adapted for short- and medium-range dogfights. It was also adapted into the Skyflash and Aspide missiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip210;The AIM-9 Sidewinder is an American short-range IR-guided missile developed in the 1950s. It has become one of the most prolific air-to-air missiles ever produced, with the USAF having signed contracts to support its operation until at least 2055.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip211;The AIM-26 Falcon air-to-air missile was a derivative of the AIM-4. It was most notable for its AIM-26A variant, which was equipped with a nuclear warhead. The missile saw limited use in the U.S., being retired after just 11 years of service in 1972.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip212;The AIM-47 Falcon was a long-range air-to-air missile developed from the AIM-4. It was originally intended as the primary armament for the XF-108 and later the YF-12, it served as the basis for the AIM-54, primarily used on the F-14.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip213;The AIM-54 Phoenix was a long-range air-to-air missile and the first active radar homing missile used by the U.S.. It was only operationally used on the Navy's F-14s until 2004, after which the shorter-ranged AIM-120 became the U.S. military's primary beyond-visual-range missile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip214;"The AIM-68 Quetzalcoatl, nicknamed ""Big Q"" due to constant misspellings and mispronunciation, was a planned air-to-air missile with a nuclear warhead designed to engage Soviet bombers. It was considered for the F-101, F-102, F-106, and F-4, but none were ever constructed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip215;The AIM-82 was a planned IR-guided air-to-air missile that was meant to accompany the F-15, which was under development at the time. Intended to supersede the AIM-9, which did not yet have all-aspect capability, it was cancelled in favor of the AIM-95, which was also later cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip216;The AIM-95 Agile was an IR-guided air-to-air missile designed to supplant the AIM-9 for the Navy's F-14s and later included the F-15. However, newer models of the Sidewinder achieved the levels of performance desired for the Agile, and it was cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip217;The AIM-97 Seekbat was a long-range air-to-air missile designed to hunt the MiG-25 (NATO codename Foxbat, hence the missile's name) while it was still believed to be a high-performance dogfighter. It was cancelled when the MiG-25's true role and capabilities became known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip218;The AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) is a beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile developed as a successor to the AIM-7 to be used on the F-15, F-16, and later F/A-18. It is currently in widespread service with many U.S.-aligned militaries around the globe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip219;The AIM-152 Advanced Air-to-Air Missile (AAAM) was a project to succeed the Navy's AIM-54 for interception of strategic bombers. Despite the protracted development process, the project was ultimately cancelled following the end of the Cold War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip220;The AGM-12 Bullpup was the first mass-produced air-to-ground missile operated by the U.S. military. The manual guidance severely limited its accuracy—often tens of meters off target—resulting in it being supplanted by more modern missiles starting in the 1960s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip221;The AGM-22 was the American name for the Nord SS.11 air-to-ground anti-tank missile. Accepted in 1961 after the cancellation of the SSM-A-23, the AGM-22 would primarily be fitted to helicopters such as the UH-1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip222;H.C. (High Capacity) bombs, frequently known as 'blockbuster' or 'cookie' bombs were a series of 4000 lb bombs used by RAF Bomber Command. These bombs had large blasts, intending to shred roofing off houses to allow the smaller incendiary bombs to enter buildings easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip223;The original design of the Q5 called for an internal bomb bay in order to reduce drag. However, this severely limited its payload, which led to it being deleted in favour of additional fuel tanks and external pylons, which significantly improved its strike capabilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/aircraft/tip224;"The name ""Falcon"" is applied to a number of missiles; the AIM-4, AIM-26, AIM-47, AGM-76. All of these missiles can be traced back to the original AIM-4.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tank/tip60;In order to prolong the operating lifespan of the engines, the Maybach HL 230 was governed to 2500 RPM starting in Oct-Nov 1943. This reduced the power output from 700 hp to 600 hp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip61;The WZ123A(Y) prototype is thought to have been built on a heavily modified ZTZ99 chassis, despite its similarity to the final ZTZ99A. Designed as a technology demonstrator, its project was led by Wang Zherong, while the WZ1001/ZTZ99A project was headed by Mao Ming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip62;After the cancellation of the initial 122 Project in 1973, the 784 Campaign revitalized China's tank development programmes. It was most known for the famous 1224 and 1226 MBT prototypes but was also responsible for the 1223 and 1225 prototypes, which later became the ZTZ88.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip63;Starting in 1974, the T-64A would be produced with the improved 125mm 2A46-1 gun instead of the older 2A26 gun. The newer gun would be constructed from higher strength materials that mitigated shortcomings in the 2A26's design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip64;"Although it may seem strange, the use of the Latin character ""Y"" in the name of the SU-100-Y is correct. It was part of a series of modifications based on the T-100, including the T-100-X and T-100-Z.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip65;"A number of early models of the Pz.Kpfw. III and Pz.Kpfw. IV have a conical housing to the front left of the cupola. This housing is known as a ""Tarnkappe"" and was a fake periscope housing.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip66;Following WWII, the US Army declared smoke mortars to be obsolete. The majority of tanks at the time, including M4 Shermans and M24 Chaffees, had the mortars removed and the holes plugged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip67;"Often, the name ""TKX"" is attributed to various prototypes of both the Type 90 and Type 10 main battle tanks. However, according to the data plates on the vehicles, only Type 90 prototypes are actually called TKX, with the Type 10 versions being known simply as New Tank or Shin Sensha.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip68;Interestingly, Japan has designated new variants of tanks simply through a change in their camouflage paint. When a new bicolour camouflage was introduced in the 1980s, the Type 74(B) became the Type 74(C), and the Type 61(B) became the Type 61(C).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip69;Although Sweden is currently the only nation in-game with a T-80 besides the USSR, it was historically trialled by the UK, US, and China, and some variants are currently operated by Yemen, Cyprus, Pakistan, and South Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip70;"While designing the Type 85 ""Storm"" series of tanks, Chinese engineers lengthened the barrel of the 105mm main gun to 60 calibres (from 52 calibres) partially to improve ballistic performance, but also to dodge British export restrictions as the Storm was intended specifically for Pakistan.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip71;Although the People's Republic of China has not fought a proper land war for decades, modern Chinese tanks have seen combat. Type 85-IIM tanks, known in Sudan as the Al-Bashir, destroyed several South Sudanese T-72AVs during conflicts in the 2010s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip72;The ZBD86 in-game features smoke grenades on the turret as part of a researchable module. This configuration was semi-fictional until in 2020 when the modification was actually seen on a PLA vehicle, meaning the in-game configuration predated the modification by over a year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip73;From the early 1930s to 1938, the Buntfarbenanstrich (colourful pattern) was used on German tanks, featuring four green to brown colours in a blotching pattern unique to each vehicle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip74;Despite many similarities, the ammunition of the 7,5cm Pa.K. 40 was not compatible with the 7,5cm Kw.K. 40 and 7,5cm Stu.K. 40. The cartridge was shortened from 75x714mmR to 75x495mmR to allow for ammunition to be stored more easily within armoured vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip75;The Pz.Kpfw. Tiger I employed a number of S.Mi. 35 (commonly called S-Mine) launchers as a close combat weapon, activated manually when enemy infantry approached the vehicle. These launchers were removed in later production runs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip76;"From 1938 to 1940, Germany used a mix of Dunkelbraun (dark brown) and Dunkelgrau (dark grey) as camouflage on tanks. This camouflage replaced the Buntfarbenanstrich pattern, and was itself simplified into the monotone Dunkelgrau in 1940, commonly called ""Panzergrau"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip77;All models of ZTZ96 are equipped with 12 external grenade launchers—six on each side—but only eight are used for smoke grenades. The remaining four are equipped with antipersonnel shrapnel grenades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip78;Contrary to popular belief, all newly developed Chinese APDS-FS is compatible with older guns. DTC02-105 can be used with the ZPL94 seen on the ZTZ59D and ZTZ88A, while DTC10-125 can be used by all 125mm smoothbore guns in PLA service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip79;In the 1950s and 60s, China manufactured copies of most of the Soviet ammunition it received, but curiously, there appear to be no records of a domestic version of BR-365A.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip80;"The famous ""Tiger 131"" is not the only to have the number 131. The number 131 correlates to Kompanie 1, Gruppe 3, Zug 1 (Company, Group, Vehicle).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip81;The AMX 45 design, which later became the AMX M 4 and AMX 50, was very similar to the Tiger II. It had a well-sloped front hull, large overlapping road wheels, an HL 230 engine, and a centrally-mounted eight-sided turret with a long bustle and narrow front profile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip82;Although primarily intended as an APC, the BTR-50P could also mount guns such as the ZiS-3 or D-44 in its crew compartment. This not only allowed the guns to be moved more easily, but also meant the vehicle could act as a self-propelled gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip83;The ZSL92 was not the first wheeled APC to see widespread service in the PLA. The WZ523, sometimes referred to as the ZSL93, was seen in limited numbers in the 1980s, while the Type 64 was produced in 1967 but largely kept in reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip84;When Pakistan procured the VT4 (known locally as Haider), a special request was made for improved FY4 ERA as opposed to the FY2 that was standard on the VT4. FY4 would become standard along with the GL6 hard-kill APS on the VT4A1, first seen in 2022.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip85;Although visual evidence of a Chinese 140mm tank gun is dubious at best, such plans did exist at some point. National standard GJB 3659-1999, which lists main gun calibers for tanks and anti-tank weapons, makes mention of a 140mm caliber for tank guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip86;For a period of time, the PLA operated 6 different ammunition calibers for tank and anti-tank guns: 85mm rifled, 100mm rifled, 100mm smoothbore, 105mm rifled, 120mm smoothbore, and 125mm smoothbore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip87;When comparing tanks of similar protection level, Western MBTs are actually not that much heavier than East Asian MBTs. The Leopard 2 A4 and M1 Abrams were both around 55 tonnes, compared to the approximately 50-51 tonnes of the Type 90 or K1.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip88;The first production versions of the Type 59 tank were not fitted with night vision equipment as China did not possess the manufacturing capability for it. However, this would be resolved in just a few years, with all vehicles being retrofitted by the 1970s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip89;China considered many different designs while preparing for the 123 Project, which eventually produced the ZTZ99. Aside from the T-72-like design, a conventional NATO-style tank, such as Leopard 2, and a front-engined tank, such as Merkavah, were considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip90;Development of the PTZ89 was initiated due to the weakness of China's anti-tank munitions against new composite armour types. However, the design was rendered obsolete less than a decade into service as MBTs such as ZTZ96 and ZTZ99 surpassed its firepower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip91;Although similar in appearance, the Romanian TR-125 main battle tank is around 15% larger than the Soviet T-72 in all dimensions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip92;Other than the standard Ob. 279 prototype, alternate versions with different armaments were proposed. Experimental missile systems, 130mm guns with absurdly large barrels, and high-powered 85mm guns were among proposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip93;The Ostwind II was developed at Ostbau by combining the 3,7cm Fla.K. 44 with a Pz.Kpfw. IV chassis and a lightly armoured open turret. Controversy doubting its existence surfaced as no surviving photographic evidence exists, only written testament from former employees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip94;BAE Land Systems South Africa developed the RG31 MRAP, which has been seen in service with many U.S. units. The vehicle has set records in survivability, seeing as many as 9 IEDs fail to harm the vehicle, with the exception of a blown tyre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip95;Waffen Prüfen 6 (Wa.Prw. 6 / Wa. Prüf. 6) was an ordnance office in charge of handling development of armoured vehicles. Other numbered offices handled other equipment, such as Wa.Prw. 4 for artillery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip96;The Cavalier, Centaur, and Cromwell were all known as Cromwells (Cromwell I through III respectively) before being renamed to prevent over complication with marks. Each model had different engines, and the latter two were designed by Leyland instead of Nuffield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip97;In both the M24A1 and M41D, the Republic of China Army exchanged a more powerful engine for a weaker one with improved reliability, range, and fuel economy. The M24 was fitted with a 6V53T while the M41 was given the 8V71T.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip98;Late models of the Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. G were nearly indistinguishable from the Ausf. H. They were fitted with L/48 cannons, Schürzen, a revised cupola hatch, and updated stowage locations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip99;The initial production versions of the Panther A were externally almost identical to the Panther D, including the cupola and machine gun port. The only observable differences are minor variations in the shape of the gun mantlet, the cut of the rear turret armour, and the loader's periscope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip100;A number of Soviet BA armoured cars were modified into ZhD models, which replaced their road wheels with railway wheels, allowing the vehicle to patrol railroads. Known ZhD conversions include the BA-6, BA-10, BA-20, BA-64, BAD-2, and FAI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip101;The PB-4 and PB-7 were amphibious conversions of the BA-3 armoured car. Less than 10 were built in total, as transitioning from water to land was problematic in non-perfect environments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip102;"The original Ob. 188 prototype was known as the ""T-72B Improved"", but the production model received the name ""T-90"". The abbreviation of the Russian for ""Improved"" resulted in the erroneous name T-72BU, a similar situation to the T-34 and KV-1s with additional armour during WWII.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip103;Wa.Prüf. 4 was responsible for developing artillery, but also delved into self-propelled artillery from time to time. One odd example is a conversion of the Raupenschlepper Ost to carry a 7,5cm Pa.K. 40/4 on a pedestal mount. 60 pre-series examples were made, and saw service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip104;Contrary to popular belief, the IS-7 features a fully automated loading system. If the tank were to be manually loaded, it would take over 55 seconds to reload the main gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip105;T-80UM2 and T-80UM-2 are both proposed names for prototype tanks developed as modernizations of the T-80 main battle tank. Neither vehicle officially received the designation, but the entries are theoretically saved for them, should they ever enter service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip106;"During WWII, gradual upgrades to tanks were not reflected in their nomenclature, with identifiers such as ""obr. 1942g."" being a postwar creation. In some cases, even the new T-34-85 was not differentiated, appearing in records simply as a T-34.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip107;"Prior to the adoption of the names KV-1 and KV-2, the tanks were known as ""little turret"" KV and ""big turret"" KV. This is even reflected in the manual, which is for both tanks.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip108;"During anti-partisan activities in mid 1943, the SS-Freiw.Geb.-Div. ""Prinz Eugen"" utilized at least 15 Pz.Kpfw. 740 (f) ""B 2"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip109;After the surrender of France in 1940, Germany repurposed their armoured vehicles for reserve and garrison units. The most numerous were the Renault and Hotchkiss light tanks, the Renault B1, and the Lorraine prime movers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip110;In May 1943, Panzer Brigade 100 reported a total of 196 captured French tanks at their disposal. Of these 196, 77 were the Hotchkiss Mle. 1938.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip111;"The Panzerkampfwagen III was developed under the code name ""Zugführerwagen"" (abbreviated as Z.W.).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip112;"The design for the E. 10 utilised adjustable height suspension, making the vehicle shorter than the ASU-57 when lowered. The vehicle was also designed to compete with the American M18 ""Hellcat"", planning to match its speed. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip113;In 1951, the Soviets created an amphibious version of the ASU-57. The ASU-57P had similar combat characteristics as the ASU-57 with the added ability to float and manoeuvre on water. Ultimately, due to the insufficient firepower and armour, it was not adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip114;"During the Winter War, Finnish forces captured two KV-1s. They designated the ""1941"" model as Ps. 271, and the ""1940"" model with additional armour as Ps. 272. Each vehicle would be identified by a -1 suffix, denoting the single example of each (Ps. 271-1 and Ps. 272-1).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip115;"During WWII, Finnish forces converted the T-38 tankette into the Ps. 601 ""T-38-34"" and Ps. 602 ""T-38-KV"" training vehicles, designed to prepare crews for using captured examples of the T-34 and KV-1.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip116;In the 1950s, the Soviets experimented with cannon-fired rocket propelled projectiles. Modifications of the T-54, PT-76, T-10, Ob. 279, and Ob. 906 were proposed, with successful tests on the ISU-152.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip117;During WWII, Germany developed a number of Entwicklungsfahrzeuge (Experimental vehicles), named as such. The E.10 and E. 25 tank destroyers, the Panther-like E. 50, the Tiger II-like E. 75, and the super-heavy E. 100 akin to the Maus. None were completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip118;In Mar 1944, the Sd.Kfz. number for the s.Pz.Spw. (5cm) was changed from Sd.Kfz. 234 to Sd.Kfz. 234/2, to make room for the 3 other models that were being developed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip119;Between 2004 and 2008, the Bundeswehr modified 70 KPz Leop 2 A6 to Leop 2 A6 M standard. This upgrade would provide additional protection against mines, and a number of internal changes were made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip120;The VEC-M1 is a modernized variant of the BMR625 VEC wheeled armoured reconnaissance vehicle. It entered service with the Spanish Army in 1998, and was seen in Iraq in 2003.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/newbie/tip121;"The Panther II was mistaken as a late-war design by historians, with a number of proposals being merged into a fictional mess of a vehicle. The real model was meant to be a ""second Panther"", with all-around improvements and a new compact turret fitting a 75mm gun.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip122;The Panther F was to use the new generation of machine guns, including a coaxial M.G. 42 (replacing the M.G. 34), and the bow M.G. 44. The M.G. 44 was a converted St.G. 44 with a new forend and fitted in a quickly removable mount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip123;The M.G. 34 ended production in late 1944, being completely replaced by the M.G. 42. This posed a problem for many tanks, as mounting the M.G. 42 in compact spaces was not simple. A mount was developed later which eased the problem, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/newbie/tip124;Engine Smoke System was developed in the mid 1950s to create smoke screens by evaporating part of the fuel in the exhaust manifolds and condensing the vapours into the atmosphere, creating the smoke screen. This process greatly increases fuel consumption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip125;Following WWII, AMX initiated a number of tank projects including the AMX Chasseur de Chars. This vehicle was proposed as a tank destroyer with a 90mm gun in a fully rotating turret. The vehicle was not built, having existed only in concept drawings and plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip126;The Fiat 3000 was accepted into service with the Italian military as the Carro d'Assalto L. 5/21. The vehicle featured two 6.5mm machine guns in an enclosed turret. 100 were built in the early 1920s, and served until the 1940s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip127;The Soviet TB-42 was a proposed armoured personnel carrier based on the ZiS-42 halftrack, capable of carrying up to 14 passengers. Allied lend-lease effectively cancelled development, with only a single full-scale mock-up on a functional ZiS-42 chassis being constructed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip128;"The name ""Excelsior"" is often attributed to the A.33 heavy assault tank, but no evidence of its use in contemporary documents has surfaced. The name ""Commodore"" however, was used alongside the Department of Tank Design and English Electric to refer to it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip129;Various Soviet heavy tanks, including the IS-4 and T-10, were not officially removed from service until 23 Sep 1997 by decree of the President of the Russian Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip130;"The name ""Action X"" often associated with the Centurion Mantletless Turret comes from a note scrawled onto the back of a photograph of the CMT and has no official basis.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip131;In the early 2010s, Syrian People's Defense Units (YPG) modified a civilian truck by heavily up-armouring it and mounting a BMP-1 turret above the cabin. The vehicle was to be used against ISIS forces during the initial 2013-2014 conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip132;In 2019, a unique vehicle dubbed BMB was observed in use by ISIS forces. The vehicle combined a BMP-1, BTR-60, and BRDM components to create a tracked armoured personnel carrier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip133;In 2015, a M1117 ASV modified with a 14.5mm KPV was captured by Syrian People's Defense Units (YPG) from ISIS forces, who had previously captured it from the Iraqi Army in 2014.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip134;"The M1117 Armored Security Vehicle ""Guardian"" was developed in the late 1990s for the United States Military Police Corps. The vehicle would later be rebranded in 2015 as the COMMANDO, when additional models were manufactured. The vehicle is slated to be replaced by the M-ATV.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip135;The German TPz 1 Fuchs was adopted by the U.S. Military as the M93 Fox (after trials as XM93). The vehicle is manufactured by GD-LS, and has seen service from the 1980s until planned replacement by the M1135 NBCRV Stryker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip136;The original 76mm Gun, M1 never reached production. A version with a revised recoil system, the M1A1, was the first to see mass production, followed by the M1A1C with threading for a muzzle brake, and the M1A2, which had 40 turns of the rifling instead of 32.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip137;When supplies of the M42 Combination Gun Mount began to run low, the M54 Combination Gun Mount was created to keep the M15 CGMC in production. The new M15A1 differed primarily in the position of the guns with the 37mm placed above the .50-caliber machine guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip138;The M19A1 GMC improved on the M19 by installing an auxiliary generator to provide power to the electrical systems without running the primary engine. The generator also necessitated a redesign of the exhausts, directing both to the left of the turret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip139;Due to problems with its targeting system, the M247 targeted the stands of the military officials during the 1982 demonstration of the vehicle. It also shot the ground rather than the drone target it was locked onto.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip140;Italian car-maker Lamborghini developed the Cheetah infantry mobility vehicle with aid from MTI. The vehicle was meant to be trialled by the U.S. Military, but the vehicle was the target of a lawsuit from FMC, claiming the vehicle was clearly a copy of their XR311.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip141;Cold War Japanese armoured fighting vehicle prototypes were designated S followed by a letter indicating the type of vehicle. For example, ST was used for tanks, SU for APCs, SS for self-propelled recoilless guns, and SY for self-propelled howitzers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip142;The M16A1 MGMC was built on a standard M3A1 Halftrack as opposed to a dedicated chassis, identifiable by the presence of a rear door and lack of folding side armour. The M16A1 also introduced the shielded M45F Quadmount and an intercom system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip143;"Although the British were the first to assign the names of American generals to American tanks (e.g. Stuart, Sherman, etc.), the U.S. Army added ""General"" when the nomenclature was officially adopted in late 1944 (e.g. General Stuart, General Sherman, etc.)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip144;Despite commonly attributed names now, the only tank to receive the official designation of Sturmpanzer was a conversion of the Pz.Kpfw. IV fitting a 150mm gun in a fully enclosed superstructure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip145;In the 1930/40s, Germany used the terms Vollketten (V.K.) and Halbketten (H.K.) for proposed fully-tracked and half-tracked vehicles. V.K. 30.01 (H) would denote a fully tracked vehicle of 30 tonnes, first project, from Henschel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip146;"In 1957, trials on an up-armoured Conqueror were undertaken to better understand the effects of shaped charge warheads. The armour package installed on the static test vehicle has become incorrectly known as the ""Super Conqueror"" in recent years.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip147;At the Japanese National Defense Military Expo in 1941, a full-size mock-up for a 100-ton super heavy tank was on display. There is no known connection between this mock-up and a real vehicle, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip148;In the early 1960s, West German forces lacked a domestic APC. A number of designs were proposed, among those was the SPz Typ B. The proposal also included a number of additional models fitting different roles, such as a tank destroyer, and anti-tank guided missile carrier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip149;The Ob. 212 was a planned tank destroyer combining the SMK chassis with the 152mm Br-2 cannon in an armoured superstructure. A single incomplete hull was manufactured by LKZ in 1939 before being cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip150;In the 1960s, the Soviet institute VNII-100 was developing a low-profile airborne light tank, with design features adapted from the BMP-1. The concept showed high performance and protection, but the vehicle was denied for lacking amphibious capabilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip151;"Prior to the M50 ""Ontos"" entering service, a number of alternate prototypes were drawn up and tested. The T166 would fit a single recoilless gun in a pedestal, while the T164 and T167 fitted a number of recoilless guns in fixed arrangements.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip152;"The T100 MGMC was a prototype self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle that merged the T41 light tank chassis with a turret fitting four .60 cal T17E5 ""Stinger"" machine guns and experimental radar fire control system.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip153;In a number of deployments, M1 Abrams' crews are given the option to assign nicknames to their tanks, and display them on the barrel. The first letter of the nickname is associated with their company, unless the vehicle is in service with the Marines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip154;During operation Just Cause in Panama during Dec 1989, M551 Sheridans were used effectively alongside infantry. The HEAT cartridge was capable of penetrating thick concrete, barricades would be crushed, and snipers eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip155;After the formation of the Bundeswehr in West Germany, the first self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle was the M 16 (M16 MGMC) and M 42 (M42 Duster). These would remain in service until the FlakPz Gepard 1 entered production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip156;The E. 10 and E. 25 were German planned light and medium tank destroyers. They each had a number of proposed experimental armaments, including recoilless guns. The fall-back weapon was the 7,5cm Pj.K. 39 L/48 and 7,5cm Pj.K. 42 L/70 respectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip157;"The index ""M4A5"" was assigned to the Canadian Ram II by the U.S. for record purposes, despite the Ram being based on the M3 and not the M4. This designation would fit alongside the Sherman medium tanks, M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, and M4A6.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip158;In 2022, General Dynamics Land Systems unveiled the Abrams-X - a technology demonstrator for a future main battle tank. It is being advertised alongside similar vehicles like the Panther KF51 and Euro MBT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip159;In 1944, the BMW 132 Dc radial engine was experimentally fitted to a Panther tank as an alternative to the HL 230. However, difficulties with access to the engine, among other factors, led to the abandonment of the project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip160;The Landing Vehicle, Tracked was originally designed for rescue work in the Everglades. The LVT(1) was known as the T33 Amphibian Tractor while in development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip161;Barnabás Kőszeghy was a Hungarian tank ace during WWII. On 25 Sep 1944 his unit was the target of a surprise attack. Kőszeghy and his crew destroyed three T-34s before he received a mortal wound, he continued to fight, destroying two more T-34s before losing his own tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip162;The pilot model for the Ram was manufactured by Montreal Locomotive Works, a subsidiary of American Locomotive Co. The U.S. designated it M3 (Canadian) and considered the index M3A6, although the latter was never assigned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip163;The M3A1, M3A3, M5, and M5A1 Stuart, as well as the LVT(A)(1), used a modified version of the M1919A4 in the coaxial mount, designated M1919A5. It different only by a new bolt-retracting slide and detent cover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip164;"The Israeli name for the M3 Halftrack, Zaḥalam, is an abbreviation of the Hebrew word for half-track, Zaḥali meḥetsah. The derived """"Zaḥalad"""" indicates Zaḥalam vehicles re-fitted with diesel engines.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip165;The test installation of the 90mm T15E1 was done on Pilot 1 of the T26E1 (T26E1-1). It was later redesignated and accepted for service as T26E4, becoming T26E4 Temporary Pilot 1 (T26E4-1) and sent to Europe. Later T26E4s were built on the T26E3 (M26).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip166;The E. 100 had a uniquely designed turret from Krupp, incorporating elements from the Maus II design. Adler employees, who were working on the hull, were given the original Maus turret design as a placeholder for internal space allowances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip167;Wargaming's G.W. E 100 is a fabrication based on the E. 100 and G.W. Tiger. No such proposal ever existed in reality, with the closest known concept being that of a Stu.G. E. 100 which would've been armed with a 15cm L/67 or 17cm L/53 gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip168;Wargaming's Waffenträger auf E 100 is a fabrication based on the E. 100 using prototype anti-aircraft cannons like the autoloading 15cm Fla.K. 50. No such proposal existed in reality, but a Fla.K. Maus was suggested by Krupp, and denied at its initial proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip169;"The Turm ""Maus"" für orstfesten Einsatz was a cancelled plan in 1943 to install a Maus turret as a defensive structure. The turret would have a thicker roof to withstand aerial attacks, and have an underground compartment for ammo storage and crew quarters.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip170;The Maus II was a planned improved Maus. The design for its turret was completed, which was largely a complete redesign. The shot trap was removed, and the 75mm gun moved above the 128mm. Plans for constructing the turret were underway, but ultimately never acted on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip171;"The Hungarian ""Tas' was a planned heavy tank developed in 1943. The tank used concepts from the Panther, the Pz. IV, and the T-34. A small number of pilot models were under construction when the Manfréd Weiss factory was bombed. The project was cancelled as a result.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip172;During WWII, Germany developed a number of 'Panzerturms' - turrets from tanks fitted to concrete bunkers with support equipment. Most famous is the Pantherturm, using turrets from Panther medium tanks. Other types used turrets from Pz. II, III, IV, and captured vehicle's turrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip173;Wargaming's Jagdpanzer E 100 is a fictional interpretation of a proposed Stu.G. E. 100, which would've been armed with a 15cm L/67 or 17cm L/53 gun. Only concept drawings of mounts exist, with the overall vehicle design never leaving the drawing board.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip174;During testing of the prototypes for the ZLT05 (212 Project), prototype No. 001 sank while doing water mobility trials due to the trim vane being retracted while still being propelled at full speed. It was recovered shortly after and repaired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip175;The 141 was a series of airborne tank destroyer prototypes developed by China in the 1970s. Armed with two Type 75 recoilless rifles and HJ73 ATGMs, the vehicle was eventually cancelled due to shifting priorities in military development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip176;Composite armour was originally planned for the M60, leading to the flattened front glacis plates. However, production limitations and the high cost led to development being cancelled early on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip177;The M48A4 was a mating of surplus M60 turrets to M48A3 hulls, as it was planned to replace the turrets of all standard M60s with M60A2 turrets. However, only a few pilot models were created as the M60A2 project ended in failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip178;The QN506 is an export fire support vehicle developed by Guide Infrared. It features a wide range of weapons, including an autocannon, various missiles, loitering munitions, and anti-infantry grenades, as well as a UAV, 360° target detection systems, and thermal smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip179;During Pakistani trials, it was found that the AMX 32 took only 30-60 minutes to replace the engine. Meanwhile, the competing Type 80-II took nearly eight hours, which was one of the main reasons for its rejection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip180;The M47M was an upgrade to the M47 that installed the engine and fire control system from the M60A1 and removed the bow gunner's position to store more ammunition. It was primarily used by Iran and Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip181;In 1952, the procurement and testing of an M47 fitted with the Centurion's stabilizer, designated M47E1, was successfully conducted with overall positive results. However, the M47 was at the end of its production, and the project was discontinued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip182;As part of his mandatory service in the Austrian military, Arnold Schwarzenegger was a driver in an M47 numbered 331. In 1992 he was given the tank for free, aside from a $20,000 shipping cost, and uses it to promote his charities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip183;Spanish-operated M47M tanks were locally designated M47E. The locally upgraded M47E1 (not to be confused with the American version) featured revised ammunition stowage and a crew heater, while the M47E2 installed a 105mm gun, new FCS, and NVD.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip184;When operated by the Commando Blindé du Cambodge in French Indochina, captured Ha-Gō tanks were fitted with additional armour, adding around 10mm to most of the hull and turrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip185;Before Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was fielding the largest number of tanks in the world. 22,600 tanks were in service, with 21,200 of those being light tanks. At the same time, Germany fielded just under 4,000 tanks in total.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip186;In Jan 1988, an East German express train on the Berlin-Halle railway collided with a GSVG T-64A tank in Forst Zinna, killing four passengers and two engineers. A 19 year-old trainee driver and his instructor were found guilty of the accident and are rumored to have been executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip187;"For the 1995 film ""Goldeneye,"" a T-55 tank was modified by cutting a hole in the right side of the hull roof to allow Pierce Brosnan, who was not allowed to actually drive the tank, to stick his head out of the vehicle to pretend he was driving it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip188;Contrary to popular belief, the VT3 is not a modernized Type 59 tank. Instead, it was planned to be an export version of the ZTZ99, but was scrapped when the more advanced VT4 was ready for sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip189;"The designations ""9910"" and ""ZTZ98"" are both fake designations for the pre-production ZTZ99. The name ZTZ98 likely comes from a series of mistakes and assumptions, while 9910 comes from a campaign name for the 10-year military development plan from 1989-1999.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip190;The British Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) had a number of variants, including the FV101 Scorpion, FV102 Striker, FV103 Spartan, FV104 Samaritan, FV105 Sultan, FV106 Samson, and FV107 Scimitar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip191;"In preparation to invade the United Kingdom, Germany developed a number of underwater modifications of tanks. These Tauchpanzer utilized snorkels and drove along the sea floor. Pz. II, III, 38 (t), and Stu.G. III were converted, but issues with ""landing"" cancelled the project.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip192;Shortly before HVSS (E8) Shermans entered production, a plan to modify VVSS tanks to decrease ground pressure was initiated. Designated E9, it installed spacers on the insides of the bogies, allowing for extensions to be installed on both the inside and outsides of the tracks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip193;"The E. 50 was a planned ""Standardpanzer"" (standardized tank) design from 1942 - 1945. Its design mimics the Panther and Tiger II, and was to use standardized parts and the most modern equipment available. The project was still in the early design phase at the end of the war.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip194;When captured by U.S. forces in 1945, the Panther II prototype had test weights installed instead of a turret. After being shipped stateside, it was given a turret from a Panther G with Fgst.Nr. 121447, and remains on display in this configuration today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip195;Prototypes for the Panther F were primarily focused on developing the turret. The first prototype Schmalturm (narrow turret) was completed in Aug 1944 on a Panther G, likewise the second prototype turret was fitted in Jan 1945, also on a Panther G.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip196;During the production run of the Jagdtiger, a small number were built with 8,8cm guns instead of the 12,8cm guns. The stock number Sd.Kfz. 185 was reserved for these vehicles, but they were ultimately not adopted for service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip197;"The name ""STC"" is sometimes attributed to prototypes of the Type 90. Although it appears in some unofficial works, all official documentation refers to the tanks as ""TKX.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip198;In 1940, Thailand purchased a number of Ha-Gō light tanks from Japan, designated Type 83. They would remain in service until 1952, although they would (fortunately) not be sent to Korea as part of the Thai contribution to U.N. forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip199;In addition to the T-80UK and UM, the AGAVA-2 thermal sight was fitted in small numbers to standard T-80U tanks. This configuration is most famous for participating in Swedish trials in 1993-1994.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip200;The M14 and M17 MGMCs were the Lend-Lease versions of the M13 and M16 MGMCs. They differed primarily in that they were built on modified M5 Halftrack, manufactured by International Harvester, rather than the M3, made by White, Diamond T, and Autocar companies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip201;Due to dwindling stocks of 37mm ammunition after WWII, the M34 Gun Motor Carriage was created on the basis of the M15A1 CGMC. It replaced the old turret with a single 40mm M1 Automatic Gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip202;"A revised gun mantlet for the Panther G with an additional ""chin"" was introduced in Sep 1944 to reduce the chance of deflecting shells down into the hull roof. This change was applied gradually but never fully replaced the old rounded mantlet.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip203;In 1995, Army veteran Shawn Nelson stole an M60A3 tank from a National Guard armoury in suburban San Diego, going on a destructive rampage. It ended after he high-centred the tank on a concrete highway barrier and was shot dead by police, who stormed the tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/newbie/tip204;"The length of a weapon barrel is often measured in calibers, which is the length of the barrel divided by the diameter of the bore.

loading/tank/tip205;During the Vietnam War, a number of improvised SPAA were created by Viet Cong forces. These included a twin 37mm Type 65 on a T-34 chassis, a single 57mm S-60 on a T-34 chassis, a single 37mm 61-K on an SU-76M chassis, and a ZU-23-2 on an SU-76M chassis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip206;On 17 Apr 2023 during Polish-Ukranian Leopard 2 training, one vehicle reversed into another at high speed, driving up the front hull and damaging the bore evacuator. The collision forced the entire turret out of the tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip207;The Zerstörer 45 (Destroyer 45) was a German SPAAG based on the Wirbelwind, but replacing the 2cm Fla.K.-Vierling 38 with 3cm Fla.K.-Vierling based on the Fla.K. 103/38. Sources vary, but it is possible that two prototypes were built and tested before the end of WWII.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tank/tip209;The concept of the tank destroyer was considered obsolete by the 1950s, and the People's Liberation Army was no exception. The only vehicles China ever made that resembled a tank destroyer were the LVT(A)(4)s armed with ZiS-2 guns and the PTZ89.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip210;"Upon discovering that the T-72 was vulnerable to 105mm M111, OKR «Otrazhyeniye» (R&D ""Reflection"") was initiated to improve the armour. Reflection-2 added a 16mm HHA plate to the hull, applied to all T-72s at the time, while Reflection-1 created the T-72B's hull armour array.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip211;The first Soviet tank to be equipped with a thermal sight was the T-80B. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a single vehicle was equipped with the AGAVA sight, although its short range, among other features, prevented its widespread adoption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip212;In German manuals for the Pz.Kpfw. 38 (t), photographs of the vehicle interior were actually manipulated from the Czech LT vz. 38 manual. This explains why German radios are not present in the photos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip213;The machine gun mounts on Pz.Kpfw. 38 (t) are fitted to ball mounts, both on the box and in coaxial positions. This allows limited traverse and elevation in addition to rotation from the turret. A number of Japanese machine gun mounts also follow this design concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip214;On 15 Feb 1940, Korps-Kdo. XV wrote to Armee-Oberkommando 4 requesting that the Pz.Bfw. 38 (t) be replaced with Pz.Bfw. III or gr.Pz.Bfw. models, claiming the optics of the 38 (t) was a detriment to its role as a command vehicle. The request was rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip215;The Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. D was an experimental model utilizing large diameter roadwheels with torsion bar suspension and the new HL 62 TRM engine (instead of HL 62 TR). 43 Pz.

loading/tank/tip216;The Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. E was a similar model to that of the Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. D, but featuring lubricated tracks. The 7 partially completed models would later be converted into Pz.Kpfw. II (Fl.) flamethrower tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip217;The Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. J (V.K. 16.01) was an experimental development of the Pz. II, being known as the Pz. II n.A. verst. (new model, reinforced), its primary feature was its 80mm thick armour. In total, 30 examples were produced and saw service with military police and security units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip218;The Pz.Sfl. Ic was a mid-1940 development of the Pz.Kpfw. II n.A. (V.K. 9.01) for a light tank destroyer. The vehicle had an open-turret fitting a 50mm gun. Two pre-series models were manufactured and served with 3.Kp./Pz.Jgr.-Abt. (Sfl.) 559 in Aug 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tank/tip221;The Pz.Kpfw. I Ausf. F (V.K. 18.01) was an experimental development of the Pz. I series. It featured 80mm thick armour and twin M.G. 34 machine guns. It was conceptualized to replace a squad member of infantry, acting as a mobile pillbox that could advance with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip222;"The Pz. IV H was originally planned to have sloped armour (Drawing W1462), but due to production schedules it was cancelled. This hull, along with a simplified turret design, are often combined into the fictional ""Pz. IV K"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip223;In 1944, s.Pz.Jgr.-Abt. 653 created a command vehicle by placing a Pz. IV turret atop a Panther hull. While it was properly armoured, the turret was not capable of rotating and the vehicle was not intended to fulfil the duties of a proper tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip224;The Mehrzweckpanzer (V.K. 28.01 (K)) was a multi-purpose tank design proposed by General Heinz Guderian in early 1943. It was meant to a variant for every combat role, from artillery observation to tank destroyer, but was cancelled by Krupp after a short design phase.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip225;After WWII, the Royal Netherlands Army operated surplus Ram II tanks. They typically had the 6-pdr exchanged for a 75mm Q.F. gun and the hull-mounted cupola removed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip226;"The ""Krasnovian Variant Tank"" was a visual modification made to M1A1 Abrams tanks to be used in OPFOR (Opposing Force) training scenarios.

loading/tank/tip227;One study on the XM1 investigated the possibility of different armaments, resulting in three different main guns: the 105mm M68, the British 120mm L11, and the German 120mm Rh-120-44.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip228;Internal classification confusion caused the Tank, Heavy, T28 to be renamed Carriage, Motor, Gun, 105mm, T95, before being renamed once again Tank, Super Heavy, T28.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip229;In 1942, Italy began expressing interest in locally manufacturing the Panther tank—before it had even entered service with Germany. However, Italy struggled to prepare for such an operation, and the plan ultimately ended when the government was overthrown and Italy joined the Allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip230;On 18 Dec 1944, an M8 Greyhound of the 87th Cav. Rec. Sq. reportedly destroyed a Tiger II near St. Vith. However, no German heavy tanks were in the area at the time, and American reports do not agree on the location, the squadron involved, or the type of tank destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip231;In Nov 1944, Krupp drafted a set of designs to improve the firepower of existing tanks, one example being a Jagdpanther with a 12,8cm Pa.K. 80 (L/55).

loading/tank/tip234;In Nov 1944, Krupp drafted a set of designs to improve the firepower of existing tanks, including a Panther with the 8,8cm Kw.K. 43 (L/71) in a Schmalturm. Further development was ordered by Wa.Prw. 6, with wooden mock-ups being created before the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip235;In Nov 1944, Krupp drafted a set of designs to improve the firepower of existing tanks, one example being a Jagdtiger with a 12,8cm Pa.K. L/66. The longer barrel was foreseen to cause a myriad of issues with transport and mobility, and was rejected by Wa.Prw. 6.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip236;In Nov 1944, Krupp drafted a set of designs to improve the firepower of existing tanks, including a 10,5cm Kw.K. L/68 in a Tiger II. Due to the gun not being accepted, the low rate of fire, and likely redesign required of the turret, Wa.Prw. 6 rejected the design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip237;In Nov 1944, Krupp drafted a set of designs to improve the firepower of existing tanks, with one design fitting an 8,8cm Pa.K. 43/2 (L/71) into the Pz. IV/70. The design was not considered by Wa.Prw. 6 as the Pz. IV was soon to end production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip238;"The fictional Pz. IX and Pz. X designs were originally published in a 1944 edition of ""Signal"" magazine to spread misinformation to the Allies about a supposed new generation of German heavy tanks. They have no basis in any real design.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip239;Preliminary designs for the Pz. III K in 1942 had a standard Pz. IV turret atop a Pz. III J hull, but this was scrapped as the weight changes would create many difficulties. The design would be adapted as the Pz.Bfw. III K, which fit a modified Pz. IV turret with a 5cm Kw.K. 39 (L/60).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip240;In an effort to standardize tank chassis, Wa.Prw. 6 requested in 1937 that Pz. IV hull production be discontinued and that a modified Pz.

loading/tank/tip266;Despite a fleet-wide upgrade of Olifant tanks to the new 1B standard which fitted a 105mm GT-3 Gun, the SADF opted to arm several Olifants with the long-serving 20-pdr due to the large surplus of 84mm ammunition in South African Stocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip267;"American observations in combat showed that the German m.S.P.W. halftrack was more effective at protecting its occupants than the American halftracks. A concept for applying a 0.1875mm armoured ""shell"" was conceived as a stopgap measure, but was not adopted.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip268;The Ratel features armoured shutters for its front bullet-proof windows for extra-protection. These plates can be raised internally by the driver with a single handle. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip269;During its combat operations debut, G-6 Renosters were reported to have been used in an attack on an Angolan airfield at Cuito Cuanavale, destroying 4 Cuban MiG-21's as they taxied for take-off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip270;Pre-production models of the G-6 Renoster took part in Operation Moduler where they are recorded to have operated in combat operations non-stop for close to a month with minimal technical support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip271;The Ystervark was equipped with a Delta IV reflector sight which could be set for targets with speeds between 200km/h and 900km/h and also featured an illumination feature for night operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip272;The SAMIL-20 based Ystervark SPAAG is credited for shooting down a Cuban MiG-23ML piloted by Ernesto Chavez on 17 Mar 1988 over Cuito Cuanavale, Angola.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip273;The Mbombe series of MRAP's were among the first in the world to deviate from V-shaped mine-resistant hulls to a new honeycomb shaped flat-hull rated at STANAG 4a and 4b.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip274;SADF mechanised units in Southern Angola identified a capability deficit in engaging aircraft during mobile operations. In response, Project Prima sought to provide an anti-air gun and anti-air missile platform based on a stretched Rooikat chassis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip275;A key characteristic of South African armour is the ability to operate in isolated positions. Consequently, the Rooikat features 'BITE' (Built-in Test Equipment) for its FCS, allowing the crew to self-diagnose issues in the FCS and repair it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip276;The demonstration model of the ZT-3 Swift missile was displayed at the 1992 Port Elizabeth Agricultural Show. The missile is noted to have had many of its prominent parts to be stamped with 'Made in Haifa'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip277;The Reumech Tank Technology Demonstrator was armed with a 105mm GT-3 main gun, as found on the Olifant tank for testing. Production examples were to be armed with the then-in-development GT-6 120mm smoothbore main gun, however, this was never fitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip278;The Ratel 60 based Ratel ZT3 ATGM carrier first entered action at the Battle of the Lomba during Operation Moduler. 4 pre-production Ratel ZT3's destroyed three Soviet-made tanks within 10 minutes at a range of over 2,000m. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip279;The SANDF Armoured Corps upgraded its ZT3 Swift ATGM's to ZT3A2 Ingwe standard under Project Adrift. This upgrade most notably featured a tandem warhead, with the first batch of 80 missiles delivered in Q3 of 2006.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip280;The Ratel 90 saw the removal of 2 of the 4 troop compartment roof hatches to fit the Eland 90 derived turret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip281;The Olifant Mk. 2 utilises an upgraded turret first developed on the Olifant Mk. 1b model. However, unlike the immediately preceding Olifant Mk. 1b with an 'Optimal' style turret, the 2b drops much of the applique, most notably, two applique steel wedges on the turret cheeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip282;The G6 Renoster was put into service under the SADF's request for a wheeled mobile artillery platform to provide support to mobile task forces over the vast Angolan frontier under Project Zenula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip283;The SADF purchased 15 surplus M4 105mm tanks from Great Britain following WWII. Known as the Sherman 1B in SADF service, these vehicles were used for training from 1946 and were phased out in 1965.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip284;Reumech's Tank Technology Demonstrator (TTD) was developed under the SADF's Project Loggim to replace the long-serving Olifant MBT's. The original project called for 282 examples, however, only a single prototype was produced before cancellation in the 1990s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip285;The New Generation Armoured Car project went through several phases. The first phase involved 3 concept vehicles, Concept 1 utilised Ratel Components, Concept 2 utilised Eland Components, and Concept 3 utilised Saracen components. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip286;The SADF 44 Parachute Brigade modified several Ferret armoured cars to act as mobile 106mm Recoilless Rifle platforms. The Yster Arend armoured car was developed as an airdroppable 106mm Recoilless Rifle Carrier to replace the Ferret but was not adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip287;The BAE OMC concern produces the hull for the G6 Renoster SPH. The sale of G6 units to the UAE in 2004 lead to the proposal of mating the G6 hull to the BAE-Marconi Marksman Anti-Air System. This project never left mock-up stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip288;The British Saracen was the only APC in use by the SADF in the 1960s. This pushed the SADF to develop an APC, which evolved into an ICV project. A number of prototypes were tested, but a proposal from MAN-Büssel codenamed 'Buffel' was chosen to be developed into the Ratel ICV.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip289;The Iklwa ICV was a development of the Ratel made by OMC intended to be a cost-effective alternative to the SANDF's decision to adopt the Patria's 'Badger' under Project Hoefyster. While costing a tenth of a Badger, it was not adopted by the SANDF.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip290;The MC-90 was a Unimog-based proposed replacement for the SADF's Eland 90 armoured car fleet. The development of the MC-90 coincided with the New Generation Armoured Car project that eventually led to the Rooikat, due to this, the MC-90 was not accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip291;Beginning in 2002, Project Hoefyster (Horseshoe) aimed to replace the ageing Ratel ICV. The development stage saw proposals from IADSA, LMT, MDB, and BAE OMC. However, when bids were opened, only a Patria-lead consortium responded with a Patria AMV variant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip292;The s.Ldgs.Tr. (Sd.Kfz. 301), aka Borgward IV c, was developed to carry explosives for later detonation. It's the heaviest in a line of such vehicles, lacking the remote-control the lighter models received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip293;In Nov 1944, Krupp drafted a set of designs to improve the firepower of existing tanks, one example mounting a Panther F Schmalturm on a Pz. IV hull. The design was rejected by Wa.Prw. 6 since the Pz. IV was to end production soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip294;In May 1945, a converted Panther D (possibly a Bergepanther D) was spotted in the city of Königgrätz (Hradec Králové), its turret had been replaced with a single 3,7cm Fla.K. 43 mounted in its place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip295;The Renault FT 75 BS was a conversion of the famous Renault FT, fitting a short-barrelled 75mm cannon. The prototype had the cannon mounted in the lower hull, but production models utilized a turret. The vehicle saw service, and fought with Vichy French forces in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip296;The H 35 modifié 39, often called H 39, differed from the original H 35 in that it had a more powerful engine. The change in armament was not part of this improvement, as both H 35 and H 39 tanks were fitted with the SA 18 and SA 38.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip297;"The Hungarian ""Tas"" tank had a proposed tank destroyer variant. After the war, a former designer re-created the design and passed it off as the original. In reality however, the tank destroyer version was nothing more than a proposal, with no known drawings created.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip298;The first prototype of the KV, designated U-0, was originally conceived as a single-turreted SMK. It retained the same armament, placing the 45mm and 76mm guns coaxially in one turret. When sent to fight in the Winter War, it outperformed both the SMK and T-100.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip299;In 1944, an experimental mount was developed for the J.Pz. 38. Known as starr, this rigid mount prevented the gun from losing its aim after firing, allowing for the gunner to re-acquire targets faster. 10 functional examples were made and serviced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/newbie/tip300;The German term Sd.Kfz. is a stock number system for military vehicles used for supply orders. For example, a unit looking to replace a Pz. IV G would order a Sd.Kfz. 161/2, but may receive a Pz. IV G, H, or J. Other systems also exist, such as Sd.Ah. for vehicle trailers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip301;In the early 1950s, Porsche developed a series of tanks, numbered B-PS 100 through 102. India demonstrated interest in the B-PS 102 (often called Indien-Panzer) and sought to produce it domestically. However, the project was cancelled in 1955.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip302;"""Shoot 'em All Down -- Let God Sort 'em Out"" was the subtitle for document AD-A272 077, covering ""Effective Command and Control for the LAV/AD"", dated 8 Apr 1993.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip303;Although there are special types of ERA for light vehicles, directly mounting ERA for tanks onto lightly armoured vehicles can increase the lethality of incoming attacks. The thin armour can be fractured or perforated by the ERA detonation alone, with potentially catastrophic results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip304;The Ferdinand tank destroyer was designed to utilize the numerous chassis constructed for the cancelled Pz.Kpfw. Tiger (P). Production was undertaken in 1943 at Nibelungenwerke, with help from Alkett and other firms. A total of 89 (plus 2 trial models) examples were manufactured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip305;"The ""Nashorn"" tank destroyer was originally known as ""Hornisse"", before ordered to be changed by Adolf Hitler on 1 Nov 1943. Soviet intelligence mistook the vehicle completely, calling it the ""Ferdinand"" in reports.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip306;Between the 5th and 20th of Jul in 1943, the average number of enemy vehicles destroyed by Ferdinand tank destroyers of the s.Pz.Jgr.-Abt. 653 was 15.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip307;The last Ferdinand tank destroyer was completed on 8 May 1943, chassis number 150100. It left the Nibelungen factory with numerous celebratory messages written on it, including best wishes for the future crew, and small artistic scenes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip308;KV-3 through KV-13 were designated Ob. 223 through Ob. 233.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip309;On 21 Apr 1945, the T26E4-1 'Super Pershing' in operation with the 3rd A.D. reported destroying a Tiger II at Dessau in a swift duel. However, this was more likely a Panther, as the nearest Tiger II was over 100 km away in operation with SS forces in Fürstenwalde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip310;The M2 and M3 halftracks had alternate models which would see use in training and lend-lease roles. The M2E5 would become the M9, and the M3E2 would become the M5. These would primarily differ in powerplant, using IHC RED-450 engines instead of the White 160AX.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip311;While the SU-122P would fare well in trials, it was noted that the loader's position was incredibly dangerous, requiring the loader to place his entire arm in the chamber during loading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip312;"The Ho-Ri had three main design proposals during its development. The so-called ""Ho-Ri I"" had a rear-mounted superstructure on a Chi-Ri hull, while the ""Ho-Ri II"" had it centrally mounted. The ""Ho-Ri III"" was like the ""Ho-Ri I"" but with a sloped glacis and was selected for production.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip313;"The so-called ""Chi-Se"" was a proposal from 1945 that was to be based on the Chi-Ri and be fitted with a 105mm gun and new suspension. However, almost all design details are unknown, including the appearance, suspension type, or even which version of the Chi-Ri it's based upon.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip314;Throughout its lifespan, the 45mm 20-K tank gun received a number of incremental upgrades, including but not limited to obr. 1934g. with a new elevation and recoil system, obr. 1938g. with an electrical trigger and stabilized sight, and obr. 1942g. with a new breech block (20-KM).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip315;It is often claimed that the Ha-To (Type 4 Heavy Mortar) and Na-To (Type 5 7,5cm Anti-Tank Self-Propelled Gun) are based on the Chi-So (Type 4 Medium Tracked Carrier) chassis. However, there is a lack of definitive evidence, and no photographs of the Chi-So have been discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip316;"During WWII, most German tanks would receive alternate ""tropical"" models for use in hot and dusty climates like the North African theatre. Simplification in production however, meant that most of these changes rolled out to non-tropical models by 1944.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip317;"The M4A3E2 Sherman was officially nicknamed as simply ""Assault"", although it's post-war nickname of ""Jumbo"" gained much more traction in popular culture.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip318;The German Panzerfaust (Pz.F.) was a cheap man-portable disposable rocket launcher utilizing a HEAT warhead. A number of models were manufactured, named after their effective range (Pz.F. 100 for 100 meters, Pz.F. 60 for 60 meters, etc.).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip319;During WWII, several different 'Flakpanzer' on the Panther chassis were proposed, including quadruple 2cm M.G. 151/20, twin 5,5cm Fla.K. cannons, an 8,8cm Fla.K. 41, and twin 3,7 Fla.K. cannons, as well as numerous other designs left in the concept phase.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip320;Like something out of a bad photoshop, the A.4E10 was a British experimental light tank fitting two machine guns in a turret—one above the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip321;The German Pz.Kpfw. III/IV was a combination of the best (and cheapest) parts of both vehicles, and while the medium tank version would not be built, a number of self-propelled guns would use the chassis to great effect, such as the Nashorn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip322;Early production of the M7 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage utilized primarily M3 Medium Tank chassis components. The suspension, lower body, and differential/final drive housing would be replaced during its production. The M7B1 would later be introduced on the M4A3 hull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip323;The two T32 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage prototypes were constructed upon converted M3 Medium Tank chassis, which would be accepted into service as the M7 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip324;The T51 25 Pounder Gun Motor Carriage was developed on the second T32 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage pilot. After issues with the gun mount, and the Canadians completing their similar Sexton design, the T51 was cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip325;The M7B1 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage saw the conversion of the standard M7 to use the newer M4A3 chassis. During the Korean War, the M7B2 was developed, which raised the mount to allow for the full elevation range the gun was capable of (from +35° to +65°).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip326;During WWII, the British Petroleum Warfare Department made a unique conversion of the American M7 HMC to fit a 9.75-inch mortar. This vehicle was demonstrated to the U.S. Seventh Army on 28 Feb 1945 in France, but was not accepted into service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip327;In Oct 1942, the Franklin Institute proposed fitting the 240mm M1918 Howitzer on a twin-hull conversion consisting of the T6 GMC as the forward vehicle, and the T14 Cargo Carrier as the rear vehicle. The gun would be located in the middle, using both to carry it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip328;"On 22 Jul 1940, OCM 15993 redesignated the M2 Combat Car as M1A1 Light Tank, and the modernized M1 Combat Car as M1A2 Light Tank. On 22 Aug 1940, the designation of ""Combat Car"" was completely removed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip329;Unlike later standards, there was no M1 or M2 Light Tank, instead having M1A1 and M2A1 as the first models. The M1 Light Tanks were re-designated from Combat Cars, while the M2A1 was previously known as T2E1 Light Tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip330;On 16 Oct 1941, OCM 17330 called for an M3A1 Light Tank to be fitted with a welded homogeneous steel armour hull, its test vehicle designated M3A1E1, and reserving the production designation M3A2. Neither model was manufactured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip331;Israel obtained much of its 200 initial M48 Patton (Magaḥ) tank stocks through clandestine trade with West Germany between 1965 and 1966. Most commonly M48A2 models, these tanks may have been provided as secret German aid, or as a third party for U.S. aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip332;Syria received 60 Pz.Kpfw. IVs of various models from several donor countries, first from France in 1951, and then Czechoslovakia in 1955, and Spain in 1965. The Syrians first employed the Pz.Kpfw. IVs during the 1964 'War over Water'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip333;Czechoslovakia operated the Pz.Kpfw. IV from 1945 to 1954 and had made a series of upgrades to its Pz.Kpfw. IVs, with many examples sporting the 'crescent' mount for the 12.7mm DShK machine gun seen on post-war T-34's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip334;Most Syrian Pz.Kpfw. IVs lacked a bow machinegun, with a plate usually installed in its place. However, a few examples captured by Israel saw that some Syrian crews substitute the bow gun with the Soviet DS-39 light machine gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip335;Project Skokiaan sought to replace the Centurion's Meteor engine. Eight vehicles were converted to house the Continental AV-1790 coupled to an Allison 3-speed automatic transmission. Skokiaan was terminated in 1974, replaced by Project Semels. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip336;The Centurions formerly utilised in Project Skokiaan were re-used in Project Semels, which added new engine modifications and increased fuel tank capacity. This raised the max range from 100km to 200km, as well as increasing the power-to-weight from 12.5hp/t to 16.5hp/t.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip337;Project Olifant in 1972 upgraded the Centurion's capabilities for threats into the 1990s. The engine was replaced with a 750hp turbodiesel V12 and traded the 20lb gun for a 105mm gun. The new FCS featured an IR sight paired to a spotlight, but lacked an integral laser rangefinder;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip338;The Olifant Mk. 1A entered production in 1983 with a major FCS upgrade, primarily the gunner sight was upgraded to the Eloptro MZS-2 dual channel sight coupled to an integral laser rangefinder. Other features included new storage bins, new electronics, and metric fasteners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip339;The 1986 Olifant Mk. 1B most notably had its power to weight increased to 15.5hp/t, had a substantial armour package added to the turret, a new thermal barrel sleeve, and a new electrical gun laying system to increase turret traverse rate to 22.5°/s. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip340;The M4A4 Sherman utilized the A57 multibank engine, which was constructed by combining five Chrysler flathead inline-6 engines to a common crankcase, developing 445 hp at 2,400 rpm. The individual engines were taken directly from civilian cars, such as the Chrysler Royal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip341;"British personnel during WWII were under a ""no unnecessary destruction of civilian property"" order. This order however prevented blind fire into a previously identified enemy position, resulting in a number of predicted ambushes to succeed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip342;The Russian use of roof-mounted slat armour popularised during its 2022 Invasion of Ukraine were first seen on Jul 2021 fitted to T-72B3 tanks of the Coastal Defence Unit of the Black Sea Fleet, and later seen that year on several other models of tanks in Crimea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip343;The Australian Citizen Military Forces (CMF) were anticipating the acquisition of Comet Tanks from Britain in the immediate post-WW2 period, the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles receiving the relevant Comet manuals. However, Centurion Mk. 3's were procured instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip344;Planned for after the initial series of 100 Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. L, a second series (starting with vehicle 101) was planned, featuring a new turret armed with a 50mm gun. This planned series was cancelled, with production ceasing completely after the 100th vehicle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip345;The Japanese super-heavy tank O-I (Mi-To) is notorious for its historical significance, with a lack of physical evidence save a single supposed track link being evidence of its construction. Numerous blueprints and other plans have been recovered, but nothing solid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip346;The Pz.Kpfw. Leopard (V.K. 16.02) was a proposed reconnaissance tank developed in 1941. Troops were in favour of the concept, but by 1943 the design was overweight. The Panther was suggested to fill the role, despite being even heavier. The Leopard was thus cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip347;In the Summer of 1943, German imports of tungsten from Portugal were cut off, resulting in the development of uranium cores obtained from stores of 1,200 metric tons of uranium, formerly reserved for the German atomic programme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip348;The R-39 was an early Soviet amphibious tank design by Zavod No. 112, two prototypes were tested unsuccessfully, with the plant and many involved punished for their failure. The project would continue under other factories, and would eventually result in the PT-76.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip349;The CM21A2 upgrade introduced major improvements to the CM21 design, including a new engine, gearbox, steering system, and other changes in line with the M113A3 RISE program. It also had improved protection against shaped charges but was ultimately not adopted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip350;In 1990, Taiwan introduced the CM24A1, which upgraded the CM24 ammunition carrier with a more powerful engine and an electric conveyor in place of the boom arm. In 1999 and 2000, the steering system was also upgraded, and the conveyor was modified for faster setup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip351;The CM27 and CM27A1 high-speed tractors, based on a shortened CM24, were designed to replace Taiwan's WWII-era M4 and M5 artillery tractors. Design began in 1988, with a prototype ready in 1994, but were ultimately not adopted by the ROCA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip352;At the end of the Cold War, the widespread decommissioning of the M60A3 TTS allowed Taiwan to purchase 160 vehicles, delivered in 1995 and 1996. Later in 1996, an additional 400 vehicles were sold, bringing Taiwan's M60A3 inventory up to 460.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip353;In 1981, Taiwan purchased the V-150 Commando as a cheaper alternative to the M113. The V-150 was used in mechanized divisions and, like the M113, was purchased in personnel carrier, mortar carrier, command variants, and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip354;The CM21 was developed by Taiwan on the basis of the M113A2 and integrated design features from the AIFV, with the first prototype being completed in 1979 and entering service in 1982. Over 1,000 vehicles were produced through 2006, including several specialized variants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip355;The M41D initiated development in 1997 in response to the 3rd Taiwan Strait Crisis, with 50 conversions completed by 1999. The vehicles received new 8V71T diesel engines, an improved M32K1 gun capable of firing APFSDS, and a modern FCS with thermal sights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip356;The CM12 was developed in the early 1990s by using the 100 extra fire-control systems from the CM11 order to upgrade Taiwan's existing M48A3 fleet. The tanks received the new FCS and 105mm M68 gun, entering service in 1992.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip357;"The CM11 was developed in the 1980s by Taiwan and General Dynamics by combining M60A3 hulls and M48 turrets into the ""M48H."" The U.S. allowed the sale of 550 fire-control systems and 450 hulls, with prototypes completed in 1988 and deliveries being completed in 1994.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip358;Taiwan initially wanted to purchase M60 tanks from the U.S. in the early 1980s, but warming relations between the U.S. and China, as well as pressure from Israel to buy their M48A5s instead of the American M60s, led to the deal falling through and the development of the CM11.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip359;Taiwan first purchased the M113 in 1964, acquiring over 1,200 vehicles of all types over the next 20 years, including the basic M113/A1/A2 personnel carriers, M106A2 and M125A2 mortar carriers, M577A1/A2 command vehicles, M113A1 TOW carriers, and even M132 flamethrowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip360;The CM22 is a mortar carrier version of the CM21, which removed the additional armour and redesigned the rear compartment for 360-degree mortar fire. It is normally armed with a 4.2in Mortar, M30, its domestic version, the T62 107mm Mortar, or the T63 120mm Mortar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip361;The CM23 is a lighter version of the CM22 mortar carrier, with similar modifications to the rear compartment to allow for 360-degree fire and fire-on-the-move capability. It is armed with either the American 81mm Mortar, M29, or the domestic T75K1 81mm Mortar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip362;Taiwan created the CM24 ammo carrier after not purchasing the M988 to support its new M109 and M110 SPGs. Based on a heavily modified CM21 APC, it entered service in 1988, but was found to be underpowered, which saw the improved CM24A1 introduced 2 years later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip363;The CM25 was created in 1987 by installing a TOW launcher on a modified CM21 chassis. The vehicle was only adopted by the ROC Marine Corps and has additional buoyancy modifications to support amphibious operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip364;The CM26 is an armoured command vehicle based on the CM21, a domestic equivalent of the American M577. It features a Battlefield Control System and can command multiple artillery batteries simultaneously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tank/newbie/tip369;A smoke grenade launcher known as the Nahverteigungswaffe was fitted in many German tanks in the early 1940s. The launcher was essentially a flare gun mounted into a rotating plug. Some crews opted to load High-Explosive grenades instead of smoke to deal with nearby infantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/newbie/tip370;Russian tank ammunition is commonly known by the projectile instead of the cartridge. It's important to make the distinction however, as projectiles are occasionally loaded into different cartridges with different loads, including some with tandem warheads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip371;3VBM17 is a 125mm tank gun cartridge, firing an APFSDS-T tandem projectile of 3BM42 Mango and 3BM44. Tandem APFSDS is somewhat common in the Russian arsenal, with at least 20 different cartridges with tandem projectiles being deployed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip372;3BM59 Svinyets-1 is deployed in tandem with 3BM65, in the 3VBM22 cartridge. Similarly, 3BM60 Svinyets-2 is deployed in tandem with 3BM66, in the 3VBM23 cartridge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

loading/tank/tip391;The Italian Carro Armato Medio Mod. 1939 featured a turret armed with twin MGs and a hull-mounted 37mm L/40 cannon. Only 100 were built, and were all lost in combat by early 1941. Some examples were captured by the Australian 9th Division, and saw limited service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip392;The Italian Carro Armato Medio Mod. 1940 was an improvement of the Mod. 1939, after experiences with combatting other tanks. The cannon was moved to the turret, and upgraded to the 47mm L/32. Around 710 were made, seeing service even after Italy's surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip393;The Italian Carro Armato Medio Mod. 1941 was a minor improvement over the Mod. 1940, mainly replacing the Fiat-S.P.A. 8 T. with the Fiat-S.P.A. 15 T..

loading/tank/tip402;While creating the T-34-100, the enlarged turret was found to be too heavy, overstressing the standard T-34 chassis, resulting in the removal of the bow machine gun—replaced by a fixed forward-firing gun—and the thinning of the roof and floor from 20mm to 15mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip403;Although the USMC's ERA kit for the M60A1 was also compatible with the M60A3, only five experimental versions were ever made. The standard issue M60A3 TTS was never equipped with ERA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip404;Contrary to popular belief, the Ob'yekt 279's strange appearance was not to prevent overturning in a nuclear blast. Rather, it was simply a quirk of the four-track configuration and the ellipsoid shape having good ballistic resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip405;Initially, the M8 Greyhound was designed with a removable pintle-mounted .30 caliber MG on the back of the turret. This was later upgraded to a .50 caliber MG, with initial versions using the M49C ring mount and later versions using a collapsible pintle on the rear turret wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip406;The pintle machine gun mounts for the M8 Greyhound were removable as they were attached to a removable plate in the rear wall of the turret. The hole was originally designed to allow easier removal of the 37mm gun but was adapted for the MG mount early in production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip407;The Carro Armato Pesante Mod. 40 (P. 40) was an Italian heavy tank, developed by enlarging an M.40 and fitting additional armour and a larger gun to it. The production model would feature angled armour and around 100 would later be produced under German occupation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip408;The Carro Armato Pesanta Mod. 40 (P. 40) was an Italian heavy tank. It was twice the weight and had a larger gun than Italian medium tanks of the era, but was still significantly lighter than contemporary heavy tanks of other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
loading/tank/tip409;The Italian Carro Armato Pesante Mod. 1943 (P. 43) was an improved heavy tank design over the P. 40.
